      Objective:I’m always curious about which model performs the best on data frames. Today I’m going to use the mpg dataset, which contains a subset of the fuel economy data the EPA makes available on http://fueleconomy.gov.
I am going to use city miles per gallon as the response variable and the rest of the variables as predictors, or dependent variables.
Split Data into Train and Test SetsI will use a 75%/25% Train/Test Split.

      Another FFTrees PostThis is great. Have you ever been on a walk in a creek and came across some mushrooms? And you think to yourself, “Man those look good? Perhaps I should bring those home?” Ok maybe not.
Well this blog is about building an FFtrees model developed by Nathaniel Phillips. The dataset consists of 8,124 mushrooms that are classified as Poisonous or Non Poisonous. Additionally there are 22 different variables identifying the mushroom.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      K Means ClusteringK Means Clustering is awesome. It’s what’s called unsupervised learning where there is no prediction variable. The algorithm attemps to cluster data based on its similarity. So in this case I’m going to feed the algorithm the petal width and petal length of three sets of flowers and see whether or not can appropriately group the data.
To implement k means we have to specify the number of clusters we want the data to be grouped into.

      Findings:It is estimated that 6% of purchasers on Amazon write reviews. If that number is constant than there was a sharp decline in Sales shortly after the publication of Mr. Comey’s Book.
I also found that the Kindle Edition of the book outsold (based on the reviews) Hardcover. It makes sense since Kindle Books are cheaper and faster to receive.

Before I start the random Forest I do some Exploratory Analysis to see those factors that contribute to a wine being classified a Good Wine.
