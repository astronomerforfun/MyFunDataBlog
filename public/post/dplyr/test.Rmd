```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


#### Objective:

I wanted to give a quick once over of dplyr in less than 10 minutes.  This is an intro that will get you started.  After watching the video pull down the Cheat sheet off of R Studio's Website and study it.  Practice for two weeks and if you like what you see give it another week and then move full time into R for analytics (you can pick up what you're missing while you're moving forwards).  If you're not into it its ok too as there are other languages, like Python, etc. that you can look into.  Good luck and I hope this helps get you started.
