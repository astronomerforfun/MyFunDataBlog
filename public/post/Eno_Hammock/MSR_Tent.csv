After 4 or 5 uses the rainfly started getting sticky.  It turns out my rain fly protected tant completely failed and now I've got a useless tent.  In effect I paid $100 per night for this rent.  Worse Cascade Designs/MSR admitted it is a known product failure but won't replace the fly.  They will only sell me a replacement for $120.  Loved the tent initially but it's useless in Colorado without the fly!  Don't buy it! ALSO, hummingbirds are killed when they are attracted to the red tent and get caught in the mesh.

"2","B00G7H9CAY","Good all around 2-person backpacking tent!","Fredonyer it is!",2018-07-26,1,"",5,"I have two of these tents, and have used them for backpacking in Sierra's, Teton's, and Glacier NP...  Total use is probably 30+ nights, and they are still holding up well.  Mostly fair weather, but I did have a couple rain events.  They are easy to set up (even the deer in the pic shown can do it!), and with some added thought (beyond a deer's skill level), they can be set up in rain to minimize inside wetness.  They aren't the lightest option, but I think they offer a good balance of weight/durability/price (I initially had a little sticker shock, but after 30 uses with no issue, the shock goes away :) ).  I highly recommend!  Note:  The deer in the pic was seeking trekking poles, and soon after pic was taken, scored one from a backpacking neighbor...  Funny stuff!

The outer tent doesn't go down to the ground, which allow wind to go freely to the inner tent. If it is cold outside, you'll feel it very well. If the wind is strong then outer tent will be pressed on to the inner, and condensate will leak trough the mesh. You can do basically nothing against it.If you put the tent somewhere not at campground, then there is maybe a little slope. With that given tent is stretching weirdly sometimes, but usually it is okay. It has very convenient system of tensing straps - 5 stars for it.Insects like mesh material by some reason. We've got few holes made by ants :-)And the worst is that outer tent has started leaking. We were using tent heavily, almost every day or every other day, for past 6-7 months. There wasn't much raining, as well as much sun(because it was used in the evening-night-morning time, to sleep), but now it leaks from the points near of where zipper begins, on the top. Also water tends to drop from the top arch pole. Probably it is coming from seams.Bottom footprint is a must have for real word usage(rocky ground, mud, etc).I like the white color of the tent, it makes very nice and bright lightning inside.

It rained a lot, and I stayed dry, and that is the paramount feature of any tent.  Add in that this goes up in a flash (helpful during a downpour), has quality construction and stitching, and is under four pounds, makes this tent hard to beat.  Large vestibule on either side give ample space to store two packs and boots.  Interior space is great for 1 person, but you could squeeze 2 in there.  Dimensions are a little smaller than advertised.  Chose this over the Copper Spur and Quarter Dome due to its beefier fabrics, although slightly heavier.  Glad i did, as i poked the fly with one of the poles pretty good in a scramble to get it up in the rain, but no damage!!  Not a fan of fragility in the outdoors where ""things happen.""  Best tent I have owned hands down.Update:  Still the best tent I have owned.  I have used this now on two backpacking trips, one in Colorado and one in Kentucky.  Both times we ran into storms and it kept us and our gear dry!  Super easy to set up, break down, and the stuff sack is great (immensely important after a long day on the trail).  Also this tent will fit two adults.  My friend and I (both around 6 feet and 230 lbs) Confirmed this on our recent trip to Colorado in high altitude, where we wanted to spit the weight of one tent instead of two.  It's tight, but doable.  Also, condensation is just something that every tent is going to have, especially with two people in this tent.

Packs small too.-Roomy: I can sit-up and not have my head hit the fly and my feet/head don't hit the ends either.  I'm 6'2"" and it is long enough and tall enough.  I use it primarily as a 1-person tent, but it can fit 2-real adults if you want/need to.-Easy Setup:  Love that the fly and tent have color matching tabs.  How many times have you had to spin your fly around trying to figure out which end is which with other tents?  Easy as pie here.-Warm and Cool:  I've been cozy in sub-freezing and cool in hot weather.  The fly gives you lots of options.  I've not used the fly and footprint alone yet, but I've set it up that way and it's easy.  I've just been chicken to pack only the fly and footprint.-I love the Mudmats.  They tie into the corners of the tent with margin under it and keep the vestibule clean.  Makes entering the tent on your knees a dry/clean event.  Keeps pack out of the muck on rainy days.  Highly recommended.-Yup.  It looks cool in person too.-Durable so far.  Yes these are lightweight fabrics, but if you take care of them....Things I don't like:Nothing.  It is expensive, but you get what you pay for.  This is a superior tent that doesn't require trade-offs.Summary - this is the 4th tent in my stable and definitely my favorite  I have a 1-man that isn't free-standing.  Yes it's light and packs in a gnat's bum, but I have to shelter my pack somewhere else and it doesn't have much more room than my sleeping bag.  I have a 3-man that has been everywhere. It's a wonderful 2-person tent, but my son uses that all the time.  It is looking for it's second trip to Philmont in 2018. I also have an old Eureka Octagon 11.

I wanted to go lighter weight and I'm so glad I did! Packs well, easy to set up, comfortable layout, excellent ventilation. I do recommend using a footprint, as the materials are lighter weight and slightly less durable. You can make your own or shell out $$ for MSR's specific one with grommets. They really don't include any accessories with this model. Guy out points were sufficient for my purposes. It could fit 2 people tightly (lager packs would probably need to stay in the vestibules, and no luxury width sleeping pads). I just used it solo in the Sierra/Yosemite and loved having that space to keep my gear inside and out of the dust. Temps fluctuated between 38F at night and 75F during day, didn't experience any condensation with vestibules closed and vents opened.

"61","B00G7H9CAY","Of the highest quality, but the similar can be done spending much less","scooterdavis",2016-10-05,1,"",4,"This tent is very light, yet constructed of quality materials. It's light enough for solo trips should you want a little more room, but not light enough for the ultralighters. It leaves a small footprint; which is handy if real estate is a concern. (Also, I would use some sort of ground-cloth to protect it's bottom). Both the tent body and rainfly are freestanding, giving you additional options. This tent is super easy to set up, but the way the doors open is a little different from what I'm used too. Instead of unzipping straight out, perpendicular to the tent body, they zip/unzip along the tent body; if that makes sense. So, the doors unzip differently, depending on how you place the rainfly. The poles are great, lightweight aluminum and linked together, and this tent comes with Groundhog stakes. (Tough to get out of rocky soil, but that's a good thing isn't it?). One con: The price. This is a very nice tent, and I would recommend it/buy it again, but it isn't cheap.

I've had my Hubba Hubba since 2006 (10 years now) and it is still in fantastic condition. I recommend buying the footprint for an extra $45 or whatever it costs now. This thing keeps every single drop of water out during storms. I've even pitched it in snow, which melted into a giant 5 inch deep puddle by morning - I was on my sleeping pad, but when I felt the tent flow with my hand, it felt like a water bed... not a drop inside the tent. The seams are incredible. It's lightweight. I have the yellow rainfly, but on the inside in the sun it's almost white. 2 hooks to hang lanterns on the inside. Large enough vestibules for large 60-80mliter packs, campstove, and shoes. Also extra loops on the inside where you can hang chord if you need to dry clothing or gear in the rain. Use the poles with the tent, tent and fly, or just fly alone if you're a weight weenie. 2 people can sit up comfortably on their inflated sleeping pads with room t spare for their heads. I've pitched this tent in storms, and it sets up in less than 5 minutes. I love this tent. It has stood the test of time. I've never had a cracked or bent pole, and man I've been drunk sometimes while pitching this thing at festivals or phish shows. My ONLY wish is that the rain fly had some sort of window, but you have to sacrifice some things to get an ultralight tent. So durable. Hold up during massive storms. I actually really enjoy being in my Hubba Hubba during storms, because you're so comfortable. Doesn't get too humid or anything. Doesn't blow around. And again you stay dry. Guy-out points on the outside keep it on the ground, during the windiest of days. Best damn 2 person tent ever.

While it is heavier than some other models I was considering purchasing (Tarptent, Big Agnes, etc), this model had the features that my wife and I were looking for as our new thru-hike backpacking shelter.A true rectangle, you get a floorplan that doesn't taper at the feet end.  This means you can fit 2 adults shoulder to shoulder and still fit.  Who wants to sleep with their face by someone else's feet after days of hiking?  I sure don't.The mesh tent body construction breathes very well, pretty much eliminating condensation.  The rainfly also breathes extremely well, allowing just enough airflow through to keep condensation down considerably while still keeping you warm inside.  The fly also has an extra optional vent on each end to allow even more airflow on those warmer nights, and these vents can also be closed with velcro.The tent is extremely secure even in high winds.  The simple setup process, including full tent, rainfly, and footprint, means you can get out of the weather very quickly.The vestibules provide ample space for a pack and pair of shoes on each side, and it also allows each occupant to have their own entry/exit point.  Critical when you need to keep gear dry, but when you also need to get in/out for those nighttime bio breaks.I'm 6'1"" and 230 lbs, and I fit great in this tent.  My wife is much smaller than me, so we fit just fine side by side and have plenty of foot room inside, and head space for our stuff sack pillows.  The cross beam on the top pole keeps the side walls away from you, making the tent walls vertical all around you.  2 storage netting shelves built into the tent provide more than enough overhead/over-foot storage for multiple items such as our headlamps, both phones, charger battery, and some other small items.With 2 people, we had this tent set up, without instructions, in 7 minutes.  On the second test, I assembled it solo and had it fully up in 6 minutes without help.  Takedown was even faster, which is always a plus when you're up before the sun and want to get back on the trail quickly.The fabric is thin on this tent (tent body consists of 2 densities of mesh, basically.  The floor is then tent material, so spend the extra $49 and get the optional footprint.  I can't overstate that enough.  This tent, including stuff sack, poles, stakes, and footprint, pack up very easily into the included top-loading compression sack and it packs small enough to easily fit inside of your pack with room for all other necessary gear.  It also straps very easily to the outside of your pack, and packs short enough to not stick out past the sides of your pack.Total weight with stuff sack, tent body, rainfly, footprint, tent pole set, and all 10 ground stakes came out to 4.07lbs on my digital scale.  Again, a little heavier than some, but lighter than many.  4 lbs truly is not bad at all for having everything you need for a full setup.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHYRWRA3CZZXMNY6YMBXV6FMTSNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHYRWRA3CZZXMNY6YMBXV6FMTSNA"

It isn't ""ultralight"" (2-3lbs) but it is light (4-6lbs). But for the price it is perfect. Did not feel like paying 50% more for the ultralight gear which is usually only for serious long term backpackers (months at a time) that need to compact their bags to under 20lbs. The material is light and yet strong. Easy to put up! I have got it down to 2.5 minutes up and about 5 minutes down (folding and what not). The alternate configurations really help when raining. Wind resistant and rain resistant. Always dry inside except for some condensation but opening a slight opening at top of door helps that issue. The fly and tent have good separation and the tent has awesome ventilation, especially without the fly! Couldn't be happier and would argue this might be the best tent as far as quality vs price goes on the market.Something to note: the poles are straight before you put it up the first time.

But, regardless where you buy it this tent is awesome!  I didn't take it in the field until about 10 months after I purchased it. I first set it up indoors and it was pretty much self-explanatory. Very very simple. The only thing I kept getting wrong is putting the rain fly on inside out :D I camped in the fall and it was in the 40s and I stayed pretty comfortable, but I used summer weight sleeping sack and blanket and should have used a winter one. I LOVE the vestibule! I put fold-up compact toilet in one and my backpack in the other. I camped solo and had lots of room to spread out my stuff, like wipes, clothing, toiletries, snacks etc.  I car camped and felt very comfortable inside and it was very windy at times but the tent stayed stable since I did use the guy lines. The only thing, and believe this is minor, but the ""ONLY "" thing they can do to improve this tent is design it somehow so when you're inside you can adjust the two side vents. Those vents came in handy when it got a little warm, you can feel the breeze and I'm sure if it was really hot outside those vents would mandatory and many tents don't even have those. So, a small modification to adjust it from inside would be marvelous so I wouldn't have to get out of my comfortable position to go outside.  Also, I like how bright the interior is since the rain fly is white. Puts you in a better mood if you're spending time inside in the daytime. I made my own footprint from one those SOL orange emergency blankets, but I plan to make one from tyvek later. If you're looking for an oversized 1 man tent with lots of arm, leg and head room and room for ALL your stuff this is the only tent I would recommend. 5 Stars!",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGRZXASYYGTOQYW62OPL4M5GJNSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGRZXASYYGTOQYW62OPL4M5GJNSQ"

I've had myself and my 5 year old daughter in here, as well as myself (5'10"", 190lb), my 5 year old (42""), and my 2 year old (~34""). All three of us, mats sort of overlapping a bit, side by side, with some gear the bottom, all just fine.The vestibules are decently wide. You can actually pitch this tent ""dry"" by putting the rain fly up first (into the footprint), then putting the tent underneath the rain fly (since it clips to the now-erect frame). The only catch to point out is that you need to take it down the same way. Whatever order you put it up in you need to break it down the same.My biggest love for this is that I can have one tent that works for me as a fairly weight conscious backpacker. It's super spacious for one person, but still pretty light. For two (or three!), it's very light.The only other caveat I'd provide is that you want to make sure you line the vestibules up with the doors. One ""end"" of the tent has the zippers going up near the top, so that's the best entrance. The rain fly also has a best end to use for an entrance. The catch is that it's relatively easy to cross it up so you end up with the vestibule opening being opposite of the best door access.

A nice feature of this tent. I also purchased the footprint, a very nice addition as it protects the floor a little better incase something pushes through.  But I hear the tent is fine without it.

I was leaving a review on another product and decided to leave one here as well.The tent is just great!!! Well worth the price. The quality of the materials used is incredible, and of course the weight of it is outstanding. As a filmmaker, it is very important what you carry and how much it weights.I definitely recommend this to any backpacker.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHDTO42S452TZS2SIWOPY4VPMB6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHDTO42S452TZS2SIWOPY4VPMB6A"

I've been through several tents looking for one I felt would hold up to any weather but is still light enough for a single back packer to carry comfortably!  The way the poles connect to the foot print, tent and rain fly is very secure with none of those little plastic clips other brands have!It is extremely easy and fast to set up!I did a lot of research on this tent and I am extremely happy with this purchase!My dog and I back pack and the 2 person tent is just the right size!  He's a black lab and he gets most of the room!  lol",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHWISXOMZDDZPESG4K5PFB2VDMIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHWISXOMZDDZPESG4K5PFB2VDMIQ"
"117","B00G7H9CAY","best tent","adamsko",2014-07-23,1,"",5,"An amazing tent.  It is extremely light, easy to set up, and very versatile (footprint required).  I live in Hawaii so this tent is perfect.  When I go camping I take the whole kit tent, fly, and footprint.  But when I hit the beach I take the fly and footprint and have a nice shaded area for me to get out of the sun if necessary.  This is a very spacious tent.  I can put two large sleeping pads and still have some space by your feet.This tent can be adjusted so many ways.  I could talk all day about this tent.  But it is just better to watch YouTube videos and you will get the picture.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEDSKE45HH4RZE2YESL573XDHT4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEDSKE45HH4RZE2YESL573XDHT4A"

"120","B00G7H9CAY","Excellent","Charles E. Irvin",2014-02-05,1,"",5,"I'm planning on hiking the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mexican border to Canada.  The first few hundred miles are mostly rocky, and I wanted a true, free standing tent because I don't plan on carrying a hammer to pound stakes in.  Although it's probably wise to stake the corners, this tent is truly free standing, even with the rain fly on.  It was very tight putting it up the first time, so I left it up for a week in the house to let the fabric relax.  It comes with a good stuff sack and the poles can be strapped independently to your pack.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZZTY7DCT5KKV7SIJPR6SCESTJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHZZTY7DCT5KKV7SIJPR6SCESTJA"
