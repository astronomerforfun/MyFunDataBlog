## First Look at Lucid

#### Objective:

I have been tasked with helping document processes for our company as we are begining the process of overhauling our systems/processes and incorporating an ERP system.  

One of the tools I was introducted to for this project was Lucid https://www.lucidchart.com.  I thought I would give my initial thoughts on the software thus far.  

#### So what is it?  

Lucid is a web process mapping software.  You sign up, pay a subscription fee and you can use and publish as you see fit.  There is also a Team Subscription that allows you and your group to collaborate.  This would be great for undocumented procedures.

There are all sorts of flow charts, mind maps, etc.  There are a ton of individual Shapes, fonts and my favorite (which has been a serious pain in every other mapping software I've used) the automatic fit of arrows.  They just flow.  



####  What does it do?

It helps with Process Mapping.  It's like Vizio but so much simpler to use (sorry Vizio).  Within the first 30 minutes working with it I created a workflow for one of the processes I take part in every day.  Moreover I was able to publish it to R Markdown (this blog was created in R Markdown) with the push of a button.  See Below:

####  Overall Impressions:

I would like to learn more about how to create Process maps.  It appears that there is a section on the website that helps with that so that's cool.  I learned a few tricks like copy and pasting blocks and dragging arrows (as opposed to creating new ones and getting the right size, etc) but I would like to learn more.  I assume with a few flow charts I'll have it down.  

Regarding ease of use.  Couldn't be easier.  It's great.  They offer a 7 day free trial so give it a whirl.  Even cleaning my house might get its own flow chart?  It's that easy and quick to create.  

I will follow up in 30 days to see where I'm at.  But my first hour long exposure has been extremely positive.
