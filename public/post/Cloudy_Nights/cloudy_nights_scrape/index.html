<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>I wanted to see if there were any trends within the Cloudy Nights Classifieds. I obtained the data using R. I also used R for the analysis.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you have any questions or concerns you can reach out to me via <a href="mailto:shockley7772@icloud.com">shockley7772@icloud.com</a></p>
<p>Histogram of the number of Views per Ad.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data, aes(Views_final)) + geom_bar(col = &quot;steelblue&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Histogram of Views per Classified ad&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Eyepiece Classifieds Only&quot;, x= &quot;Number of Views per Ad&quot;, y = &quot;Frequency&quot;, caption = &quot;Source: Cloudy Nights Classifieds&quot;) + theme_bw() </code></pre>

<p>Looks as if most of the classified ads get around 250 looks. But what are the items that are getting over 500?</p>

<p>Looks like Garage Sales get the most Views.</p>
<p>Are there any trends with the number of Views for each Classified ad over time?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data%&gt;%

<p><img src="/post/Cloudy_Nights/Cloudy_Nights_Scrape_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It appears that there is a strong upward trend in ads over the two year time period, however there has been a drop since the beginning of the year. It also seems like the market may be softening since the mean number of views is declining.</p>
<p>How about Views per Ad over time?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data%&gt;%
filter(data$date &gt; &quot;2017-01-01&quot;)%&gt;%
  group_by(week = floor_date(date, &quot;week&quot;))%&gt;%
  summarise(Average_Number_of_Ads = n(), mean_views = mean(Views_final, na.rm = T))%&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(week, mean_views, colour = Average_Number_of_Ads)) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + geom_line(fill=&#39;steelblue&#39;, size = 2) + theme_bw() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, col = &quot;firebrick&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Number of Views increasing over time?&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Number of Views (aggregated by Month)&quot;, y = &quot;Average Number of Views&quot;, x = &quot;Months&quot;, caption = &quot;Source: Cloudy Nights&quot;) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Ignoring unknown parameters: fill</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/Cloudy_Nights/Cloudy_Nights_Scrape_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It appears again that the amount of Ads is increasing but the Views is decreasing. **In essence the classified market for Eyepieces on Cloudy Nights is softening.</p>
<p>Letâs look at Avg Weekly Ads and Avg Weekly Views</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data%&gt;%
filter(data$date &gt; &quot;2017-01-01&quot;)%&gt;%
  group_by(week = floor_date(date, &quot;week&quot;))%&gt;%
  summarise(Average_Number_of_Ads = n(), mean_views = mean(Views_final, na.rm = T))%&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(Average_Number_of_Ads, mean_views)) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + geom_point(fill=&#39;steelblue&#39;, size = 2) + theme_bw() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, col = &quot;firebrick&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Are Views on Ads decreasing?&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Views/Ads (aggregated by Week)&quot;, y = &quot;Average Weekly Number of Views&quot;, x = &quot;Avg Weekly Ads&quot;, caption = &quot;Source: Cloudy Nights&quot;) </code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/Cloudy_Nights/Cloudy_Nights_Scrape_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Based on the Chart it appears that there is a loose correlation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cor.test &lt;- data%&gt;%
filter(data$date &gt; &quot;2017-01-01&quot;)%&gt;%
  group_by(week = floor_date(date, &quot;week&quot;))%&gt;%
  summarise(Average_Number_of_Ads = n(), mean_views = mean(Views_final, na.rm = T))
cor.test(cor.test$Average_Number_of_Ads, cor.test$mean_views)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##

<p>The Corellation Test shows a corellation of 56, which isnât that strong. But there is a corrlation since the p value is significant &lt; .05</p>
<p>How about Regression?</p>

<p>Multiple R Squared is .34. This means that 34% of the weekly mean views can be explained by the weekly mean ads.</p>
<p>Conclusion: It appears that the views are declining and after testing the hypothesis they are indeed decreasing (statistically significant). The cause is unknown.</p>
<p>Hereâs the data in DT for you to filter and look at. I filtered out those with Views less than 250 for size concerns.</p>
