      <description>I’ve never been good with saying good-bye. But that’s exactly what I find myself doing. Waving good bye to Summer and its caravans of warm sunny days, clear lakes and long evenings trail behind. And even if the curtain comes back up in September and Summer plays a finale – I know – the show – is coming to an end. It just sucks!
Over the past few months I have had the best time – from my first overnight hike (in the dark) at Ancient Lakes to climbing 4,000 ft with my Niece at Crystal Mountain inside Mount Rainier National Park.</description>

      <description>Introduction:
I wanted to see if there were any trends within the Cloudy Nights Classifieds. I obtained the data using R. I also used R for the analysis.
If you have any questions or concerns you can reach out to me via shockley7772@icloud.com
Histogram of the number of Views per Ad.
ggplot(data, aes(Views_final)) + geom_bar(col = &amp;quot;steelblue&amp;quot;) + labs(title = &amp;quot;Histogram of Views per Classified ad&amp;quot;, subtitle = &amp;quot;Eyepiece Classifieds Only&amp;quot;, x= &amp;quot;Number of Views per Ad&amp;quot;, y = &amp;quot;Frequency&amp;quot;, caption = &amp;quot;Source: Cloudy Nights Classifieds&amp;quot;) + theme_bw() Looks as if most of the classified ads get around 250 looks.</description>

      <description>Objective:I was curious what a sermon would look like doing text analysis with the Syuzhet Package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/syuzhet/vignettes/syuzhet-vignette.html). I chose Pastor Tim Knight’s Easter message. I obatined the mp4 off of the Church website and converted it to text using an application (I didn’t know that could be done). I then uploaded the text into R and began the analysis which can be seen below.</description>

      <title>Jim Comey&#39;s A Higher Loyalty Amazon Review Analysis</title>
      <link>/post/jim_comey/comey_markdown/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 10:58:08 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/jim_comey/comey_markdown/</guid>
      <description>Findings:It is estimated that 6% of purchasers on Amazon write reviews. If that number is constant than there was a sharp decline in Sales shortly after the publication of Mr. Comey’s Book.
I also found that the Kindle Edition of the book outsold (based on the reviews) Hardcover. It makes sense since Kindle Books are cheaper and faster to receive.
The Bigram Word Cloud turned out well and is informative.</description>

      <title>Red Wine Analysis</title>

      <guid>/post/red_wine/wine_report/</guid>
      <description>Objective: My objective was to see if I could predict whether a wine was good or bad using the Random Forest Algorithm (using Random Forest and FFTrees). To run the model I train it on 70% of the data. I then test it against the test set or the other 30% to see how it does. Before I start the random Forest I do some Exploratory Analysis to see those factors that contribute to a wine being classified a Good Wine.</description>
