      <description>Introduction:
I wanted to see if there were any trends within the Cloudy Nights Classifieds. I obtained the data using R. I also used R for the analysis.

Histogram of the number of Views per Ad.
ggplot(data, aes(Views_final)) + geom_bar(col = &amp;quot;steelblue&amp;quot;) + labs(title = &amp;quot;Histogram of Views per Classified ad&amp;quot;, subtitle = &amp;quot;Eyepiece Classifieds Only&amp;quot;, x= &amp;quot;Number of Views per Ad&amp;quot;, y = &amp;quot;Frequency&amp;quot;, caption = &amp;quot;Source: Cloudy Nights Classifieds&amp;quot;) + theme_bw() Looks as if most of the classified ads get around 250 looks.</description>

      <description>Objective:I was curious what a sermon would look like doing text analysis with the Syuzhet Package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/syuzhet/vignettes/syuzhet-vignette.html). I chose Pastor Tim Knight’s Easter message. I obatined the mp4 off of the Church website and converted it to text using an application (I didn’t know that could be done). I then uploaded the text into R and began the analysis which can be seen below.</description>

      <title>Jim Comey&#39;s A Higher Loyalty Amazon Review Analysis</title>

      <description>Findings:It is estimated that 6% of purchasers on Amazon write reviews. If that number is constant than there was a sharp decline in Sales shortly after the publication of Mr. Comey’s Book.
There was also a surprise to me. I found that the Kindle Edition of the book outsold (based on the reviews) Hardcover. It makes sense since Kindle Books are cheaper and faster to receive.</description>
