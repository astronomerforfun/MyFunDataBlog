      <description>K Means ClusteringK Means Clustering is awesome. It’s what’s called unsupervised learning. The algorithm attemps to cluster data based on its similarity. So in my case I’m going to feed it the petal width and petal length of three sets of flowers and see if it can appropriately group the data. This of course is much different than trying to predict some variable.
To implement k means we have to specify the number of clusters we want the data to be grouped into.</description>
