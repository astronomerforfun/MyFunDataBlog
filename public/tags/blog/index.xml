      <description>I’ve never been good with saying good-bye. But that’s exactly what I find myself doing. Waving good bye to Summer and its caravans of warm sunny days, clear lakes and long evenings trail behind. And even if the curtain comes back up in September and Summer plays a finale – I know – the show – is coming to an end. It just sucks!
Over the past few months I have had the best time – from my first overnight hike (in the dark) at Ancient Lakes to climbing 4,000 ft with my Niece at Crystal Mountain inside Mount Rainier National Park.</description>
