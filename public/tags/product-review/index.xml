      <description>First Look at LucidObjective:I have been tasked with helping document processes for our company as we are begining the process of overhauling our systems/processes and incorporating an ERP system.
One of the tools I was introducted to for this project was Lucid https://www.lucidchart.com. I thought I would give my initial thoughts on the software thus far.
So what is it?Lucid is a web process mapping software. You sign up, pay a subscription fee and you can use and publish as you see fit.</description>
