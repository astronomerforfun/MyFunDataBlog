      <description>What is Slack?Slack is to project communication what dropbox is to sharing documents. A formal definition is a web based software that serves as a communication hub or those invited.
These guys got it right too. I recently started a consulting gig where I was introduced to the app. I found that the CEO on down to the developers were incredibly active – in fact they didn’t use email they just used the message board to communicate.</description>

      <description>First Look at LucidObjective:I have been tasked with helping document processes for our company as we are begining the process of overhauling our systems/processes and incorporating an ERP system.
One of the tools I was introducted to for this project was Lucid https://www.lucidchart.com. I thought I would give my initial thoughts on the software thus far.
So what is it?Lucid is a web process mapping software. You sign up, pay a subscription fee and you can use and publish as you see fit.</description>
