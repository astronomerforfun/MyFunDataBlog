      <description>Objective:To get some practice with the Caret Package and some of its Machine Learning Alogorithms. We will look at the famous diamonds dataset, strip out the Good and Ideal cut diamonds and then build a model that will predict future Good and Ideal cut diamonds.
Order of Operations:
Take a random sample (5,000) of the diamonds data frame using the sample_n function in dplyr.Filter the Ideal and Good diamonds using filter from dplyr.</description>

      <description>Objective:Get practice running models and comparing them using the caret package. Turns out that itâ€™s very easy to run multiple algorithms in caret, compile them and compare which is the best. This solves my problem of having messy and long code. I understand too that there is a caretEnsemble package. I will not be using it in this post.
DatasetThis is a dataset that consists of 768 obs and 9 variables.</description>
