      <description>The Famous ROC CurveROC stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic. Its origin is from sonar back in the 40’s, where it was used to identify submarines – it likely helped save some schools of fish too as they could be misclassified as submarines and torpedoed. The ROC curve was an important metric in WWII and continues to be today.
Today the ROC curve is used in predictive modelling to distinguish between true positives and true negatives.</description>
