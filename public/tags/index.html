      What is Slack?Slack is to project communication what dropbox is to sharing documents. A formal definition is a web based software that serves as a communication hub or those invited.
These guys got it right too. I recently started a consulting gig where I was introduced to the app. I found that the CEO on down to the developers were incredibly active – in fact they didn’t use email they just used the message board to communicate.

      Seattle Sunny Day StreaksObjective: If you’re like me when the sun comes out after a couple cloudy days my mood lifts quite a bit - even more so than when it’s been sunny for a couple days. Perhaps its the contrast between the two? Nevertheless I was curious how many shifts on average we will have from cloudy days to sunny days, in other words how many mood lifts can we estimate to have in a year living in Seattle.

      I’ve never been good with saying good-bye. But that’s exactly what I find myself doing. Waving good bye to Summer and its caravans of warm sunny days, clear lakes and long evenings trail behind. And even if the curtain comes back up in September and Summer plays a finale – I know – the show – is coming to an end. It just sucks!
Over the past few months I have had the best time – from my first overnight hike (in the dark) at Ancient Lakes to climbing 4,000 ft with my Niece at Crystal Mountain inside Mount Rainier National Park.

      First what is Deep Learning?Deep Learning. Uhhh… Hmmmm… Well… I know how to implement some of these deep(er) learning algorithms/models, but I’m just now getting my brain around how they work. So I’m coming clean (and I feel so much lighter). My thinking is if I test my model on new data (data the model hasn’t seen) many times over and get good results (that are measurable and repeatable) no need to be concerned with how the thing works under the hood?

I have had this data set for a while. I was curious to see if there were any patterns within it. While this analysis is exploratory in nature and I didn’t set out to answer a particular question, I did, however, find myself asking questions.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Objective: My objective was to see if I could predict whether a wine was good or bad using the Random Forest Algorithm (using Random Forest and FFTrees). To run the model I train it on 70% of the data. I then test it against the test set or the other 30% to see how it does. Before I start the random Forest I do some Exploratory Analysis to see those factors that contribute to a wine being classified a Good Wine.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Objective:So in this blog I am going to go through a lesson I recently took with a gentlemen by the name Bharatendra Rai, where he goes through the glmnet model in detail.
The reason this model is great is that you can hypretune it, which you will see momentarily. It is an equal to the Random Forests but where glmnet takes the lead is with the amount of information you can pull from the model and its parameters.

      I’ve never been good with saying good-bye. But that’s exactly what I find myself doing.

To run the model I train it on 70% of the data. I then test it against the test set or the other 30% to see how it does. Before I start the random Forest I do some Exploratory Analysis to see those factors that contribute to a wine being classified a Good Wine.

I also found that the Kindle Edition of the book outsold (based on the reviews) Hardcover. It makes sense since Kindle Books are cheaper and faster to receive.

      Seattle Sunny Day StreaksObjective: If you’re like me when the sun comes out after a couple cloudy days my mood lifts quite a bit - even more so than when it’s been sunny for a couple days. Perhaps its the contrast between the two?

      Objective:I was curious what a sermon would look like doing text analysis with the Syuzhet Package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/syuzhet/vignettes/syuzhet-vignette.html). I chose Pastor Tim Knight’s Easter message. I obatined the mp4 off of the Church website and converted it to text using an application (I didn’t know that could be done).

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Findings:It is estimated that 6% of purchasers on Amazon write reviews. If that number is constant than there was a sharp decline in Sales shortly after the publication of Mr. Comey’s Book.
I also found that the Kindle Edition of the book outsold (based on the reviews) Hardcover. It makes sense since Kindle Books are cheaper and faster to receive.
The Bigram Word Cloud turned out well and is informative.

So in this case I’m going to feed the algorithm the petal width and petal length of three sets of flowers and see whether or not can appropriately group the data.
To implement k means we have to specify the number of clusters we want the data to be grouped into.
