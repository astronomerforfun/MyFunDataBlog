    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      ObjectiveOne of the issues when running a multi linear problem is being able to visualize what is going on within the data graphically. Because of the limits of the human eye we are only able to see at most 3 variables and even then it’s terribly difficult. But what if there are more than 3 variables? What then? Well that’s when Principle Component Analysis comes to the rescue. Using ggbiplot a package we can use the linear combination of continuous variables and graph those components respectively after normalization.

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Image ClassificationObjective: I wanted to see if I could build a Neural Network that could identify a Plane vs a Car. To do so I downloaded 12 pictures, 6 of which were airplanes and 6 that were cars. I then created the Network using Google Tensorflow and Keras Package to train the model. I then tested the model on two pictures. The results are below:
Methodology:
Download Pictures using ReadImagesNormalize Pictures since they are different sizesReshape Pictures for Model using array_reshape from Keras PackageCreate Training Set and Training Labels/Create Test Set and LabelsBuild Neural NetworkRun the ModelTest model on never before seen pictures.

The goal of the exercise is to take 11,286 Reuters News Wires that have been bucketed into 46 possible classifications (i.e, Finance, Politics, etc.). I will be building a Neural Network on 80% of the data and then testing the network on the remaining 20%.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Objective:Get practice running models and comparing them using the caret package. Turns out that it’s very easy to run multiple algorithms in caret, compile them and compare which is the best. This solves my problem of having messy and long code. I understand too that there is a caretEnsemble package. I will not be using it in this post.

      First what is Deep Learning?Deep Learning. Uhhh… Hmmmm… Well… I know how to implement some of these deep(er) learning algorithms/models, but I’m just now getting my brain around how they work. So I’m coming clean (and I feel so much lighter). My thinking is if I test my model on new data (data the model hasn’t seen) many times over and get good results (that are measurable and repeatable) no need to be concerned with how the thing works under the hood?

      The Famous ROC CurveROC stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic. Its origin is from sonar back in the 40’s, where it was used to identify submarines. The ROC curve was an important metric in WWII and continues to be today.
Today the ROC curve is used in predictive modelling to distinguish between true positives and true negatives. But if you’re like me you need to see it in action to really understand.

Moreover by writing it out and I am reinforcing my learning and helping out newcomers to the world of R and machine learning. I hope you enjoy.

      Objective:So in this blog I am going to go through a lesson I recently took with a gentlemen by the name Bharatendra Rai, where he goes through the glmnet model in detail.
The reason this model is great is that you can hypretune it, which you will see momentarily. It is an equal to the Random Forests but where glmnet takes the lead is with the amount of information you can pull from the model and its parameters.

        Can the k means algorithm correctly identify a flower by its petal length and width alone?
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      K Means ClusteringK Means Clustering is awesome. It’s what’s called unsupervised learning where there is no prediction variable. The algorithm attemps to cluster data based on its similarity. So in this case I’m going to feed the algorithm the petal width and petal length of three sets of flowers and see whether or not can appropriately group the data.
To implement k means we have to specify the number of clusters we want the data to be grouped into.
