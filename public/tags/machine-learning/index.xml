      <description>The Famous ROC CurveROC stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic. Its origin is from sonar back in the 40’s, where it was used to identify submarines – it likely helped save some schools of fish too as they could be misclassified as submarines and torpedoed. The ROC curve was an important metric in WWII and continues to be today.
Today the ROC curve is used in predictive modelling to distinguish between true positives and true negatives.</description>

      <description>K Means ClusteringK Means Clustering is awesome. It’s what’s called unsupervised learning where there is no prediction variable. The algorithm attemps to cluster data based on its similarity. So in this case I’m going to feed the algorithm the petal width and petal length of three sets of flowers and see whether or not can appropriately group the data.
To implement k means we have to specify the number of clusters we want the data to be grouped into.</description>
