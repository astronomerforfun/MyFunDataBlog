      <description>The Famous ROC CurveROC stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic. Its origin is from sonar back in the 40’s, where it was used to identify submarines – it likely helped save some schools of fish too as they could be misclassified as submarines and torpedoed. The ROC curve was an important metric in WWII and continues to be today.
Today the ROC curve is used in predictive modelling to distinguish between true positives and true negatives.</description>

      <description>Objective:I’m always curious about which model performs the best on data frames. Today I’m going to use the mpg dataset, which contains a subset of the fuel economy data the EPA makes available on http://fueleconomy.gov.
I am going to use city miles per gallon as the response variable and the rest of the variables as predictors, or dependent variables. I am also going to use the RMSE measure to compare the models.</description>

      <description>Reshape Data Practice (Melt/Casting/Recast)
Objective:
No this isn’t about a tuna melt, though looking at this sandwich makes me hungry. Rather this about the melt function and others in the Reshape package.
If you’re like me you have to go look up the documentation each time a reshape is needed for data. I want to get ahead of the curve and practice. I found a great website with some exercises written by John Akwei - it can be found @ https://www.</description>
