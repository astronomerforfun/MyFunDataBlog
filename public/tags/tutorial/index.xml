      <title>Neural Network on the Reuters Data Set!</title>

      <description>Objective:This is an example in a book I’m reading by Rick Scavetti. My goal is to work out this example for reinforcement and to share.
The goal of the exercise is to take 11,286 Reuters News Wires that have been bucketed into 46 possible classifications (i.e, Finance, Politics, etc.). I will be building a Neural Network on 80% of the data and then testing the network on the remaining 20%.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks - Super Cool!</title>

      <description>Objective:I am really into building models. I bought a book by Rick Scavetta. A Deep Learning Expert. I am going to blog my exercises to share and also so I can remember them.
The first exercise is building a simple Neural Network where I’ll train a model of handwritten numbers using the famous mnist dataset, which is a total of 70,000 handwritten digits from High School Students and those at the Census Bureau.</description>

      <title>An Easier Way to Communicate on Projects (good bye email)</title>

      <description>What is Slack?Slack is to project communication what dropbox is to sharing documents. A formal definition is a web based software that serves as a communication hub for those invited.
These guys got it right too. I recently started a consulting gig where I was introduced to the app. I found that the CEO on down to the developers were incredibly active – in fact they didn’t use email they just used the message board to communicate.</description>

      <title>Google -- Thank you for giving us Tensorflow and Keras...</title>

      <description>First what is Deep Learning?Deep Learning. Uhhh… Hmmmm… Well… I know how to implement some of these deep(er) learning algorithms/models, but I’m just now getting my brain around how they work. So I’m coming clean (and I feel so much lighter). My thinking is if I test my model on new data (data the model hasn’t seen) many times over and get good results (that are measurable and repeatable) no need to be concerned with how the thing works under the hood?</description>

      <title>The ROC Curve - Is it a Mine or a Rock? - Pick your Sensitivity</title>

      <description>The Famous ROC CurveROC stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic. Its origin is from sonar back in the 40’s, where it was used to identify submarines. The ROC curve was an important metric in WWII and continues to be today.
Today the ROC curve is used in predictive modelling to distinguish between true positives and true negatives. But if you’re like me you need to see it in action to really understand.</description>

      <title>Complete Review of the Random Forest Package</title>

      <description>Random Forest Package ReviewObjective:I wanted to learn about the Random Forest package. See what its strengths and weaknesses are. By doing this case study (inspired by Bharatendra Rai) I really have a much better understanding of the package. Moreover by writing it out and I am reinforcing my learning and helping out newcomers to the world of R and machine learning. I hope you enjoy.

      <title>Showdown:  Random Forest vs Regression on EPA MPG Dataset</title>
      <link>/post/showdown/showdown/</link>

      <guid>/post/showdown/showdown/</guid>
      <description>Objective:I’m always curious about which model performs the best on data frames. Today I’m going to use the mpg dataset, which contains a subset of the fuel economy data the EPA makes available on http://fueleconomy.gov.
I am going to use city miles per gallon as the response variable and the rest of the variables as predictors, or dependent variables. I am also going to use the RMSE measure to compare the models.</description>

      <title>What?  Hypertune Using glmnet and Caret by Max Kuhn?  Pass it along.</title>

      <guid>/post/glmnet/glmnet/</guid>
      <description>Objective:So in this blog I am going to go through a lesson I recently took with a gentlemen by the name Bharatendra Rai, where he goes through the glmnet model in detail.
The reason this model is great is that you can hypretune it, which you will see momentarily. It is an equal to the Random Forests but where glmnet takes the lead is with the amount of information you can pull from the model and its parameters.</description>

      <description>Web Scraping Tutorial (Wiki Tables)One of my favorite things to do is to scrape web data for analysis in R. Below you will find a simple example where we will scrape a list of Messier Objects from Wiki.
Workflow for Scraping Wiki TablesRead in page needed to scrape;Scrape the Table using Rvest (Wiki Tables do not need the Node function);Convert to Data Frame;Clean up Data;Analyze.</description>

      <description>Is Regex Necessary?Yep. If you’re new to programming or R. Learn Regex. It will help you so much when your data asks of you to do data-gymnastics. Below you will find the steps I took to start learning Regex.
Online Tutorialhttp://www.regexone.com
This is a great site to get your feet wet. You can do it in an hour and when you’re done you’ll have a working knowledge of Regex and be able to do the most common Regex tasks.</description>

      <title>Why Melt and Cast When You Can Recast?</title>

      <description>Reshape Data Practice (Melt/Casting/Recast)
Objective:
No this isn’t about a tuna melt, though looking at this sandwich makes me hungry. Rather this about the melt function and others in the Reshape package.
If you’re like me you have to go look up the documentation each time a reshape is needed for data. I want to get ahead of the curve and practice. I found a great website with some exercises written by John Akwei - it can be found @ https://www.</description>
