      <description>Quick EA on Messier and Herschel Data Sets
Purpose:
I have had this data set for a while. I was curious to see if there were any patterns within it. While this analysis is exploratory in nature and I didnâ€™t set out to answer a particular question, I did, however, find myself asking questions. Like how did Messier miss all the objects that Herschel had found in Ursa Major (Big Dipper)?</description>

      <description>Objective: My objective was to see if I could predict whether a wine was good or bad using the Random Forest Algorithm (using Random Forest and FFTrees). To run the model I train it on 70% of the data. I then test it against the test set or the other 30% to see how it does. Before I start the random Forest I do some Exploratory Analysis to see those factors that contribute to a wine being classified a Good Wine.</description>
