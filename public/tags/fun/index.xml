      <description>Quick EA on Messier and Herschel Data Sets
Purpose:
I have had this data set for a while. I was curious to see if there were any patterns within it. While this analysis is exploratory in nature I found that there are more questions. Like how did Messier miss all the objects that Herschel found in Ursa Major? Overall the analysis was cool in the sense that I have a better understanding of the catalogues and what comprises them.</description>
