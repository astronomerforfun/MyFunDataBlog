# Business Stuff
I have a Bachelors Degree in Business/Finance from Seattle Pacific University.  I have worked in the corporate arena for 15 years.  Currently I work as a Data/Financial Analyst for a Metals Co. where I prepare Reports and Build Applications for upper management.  I also work as a consultant part time where I help small to mid-sized companies take advantage of their data to increase profitablity.  And for fun I teach R Programming.  


# For Fun
 I was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest.  I like it here because there is so much to do. There are Mountains to climb an hour a way {{< figure src="/images/rainer.jpg" title="Picture from Crystal Peak Mt. Rainier National Park Oct. 2018" >}}, lakes to swim, and beaches to walk. And my dog Coog reminds me every day about the walk part.  
 
I'm also into Astronomy.  On any given weekend you can find me at a local park with my astronomy friends (we try to get out at least once a month). {{< figure src="/images/telescope.jpg" title="Set Up:  8in Celestron SCT, Celestron CGX Mount" >}} We pull out our Telescopes and have fun finding the likes of Andramada, Orion's Nebula, Saturn, etc.
