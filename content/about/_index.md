{{< figure src="/images/rainer.jpg" title="Picture from Crystal Peak Mt. Rainier National Park Oct. 2018" >}} I was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest.  I love it here.  There are Mountains to climb an hour a way, lakes to swim, and beaches to walk. And my dog Coog reminds me every day about the walk part.

I work as a Data/Financial Analyst for a Metals Co. where I prepare Reports and Build Applications for upper management.  I also work as a consultant part time where I help small to mid-sized companies take advantage of their data to increase profitablity.  I also teach for R Programming.  In other words, I'm busy.
