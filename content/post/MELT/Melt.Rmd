#Reshape Data Practice (Melt/Casting/Recast)

<br>

### Objective:
<br>
No this isn't about a tuna melt, though looking at this sandwich makes me hungry.  Rather this about the *melt* function and others in the Reshape package.  
If you're like me you have to go look up the documentation each time a reshape is needed for data.  I want to get ahead of the curve and practice.  I found a great website with some exercises written by John Akwei - it can be found @ https://www.r-exercises.com/2016/08/26/reshape-2-exercises/.  I'm going to walk through them in this blog.
<br>

### Conclusion:
As I walked through these exercises I was trying to see where Akwei was leading.  The first four exercises repeated the melt and then casting functions.  It wasn't until I used recast at the end that I realized that the answers were the same as the casting functions.  After a quick google search on what the difference between dcast and recast did I find the purpose of the tutorial.  Essentially, recast wraps the melt procedure with the dcast in one step.  Very handy.  I am glad that I worked through the exercises so I know what's going on behind the scenes.  I hope this helps you too.  

<br>


###Exercise I
<br>
Create a new object to store mtcars (prebuilt df in R) and convert it to long format using the id variables, "cyl", "gear".  Before let's look at mtcars first 5 rows for a before and after.


```{r}
library(reshape2) #library of the casting functions
```

```{r}
head(mtcars, 5) #glimpse of the data
```
<br>
Alright so now I have cyl and gear variable and all other variables in the variable column with their respective values.  I'm not sure what this would be good for yet but I think I still have to cast it so I'll wait until the next exercise.

<br>

```{r}
ex1 <- melt(mtcars, id.vars = c("cyl", "gear"))
head(ex1, 5)
```

###Exercise 2
<br>
Question 2 asked to use dcast on the cyl and gear columns/vectors from above.  Now this is making more sense.  Basically I have the averages of the data.frame for cyl and gear for all the other variables.  For example, if a car has 4 cyl and 3 gears the average mpg is 21.5.  Ok that's useful.  

If I think of pivot tables in Excel I can only do one query, whereas here I can do more than one.  This could come in real handy.
<br>

```{r}
carsurvey <- dcast(ex1, cyl + gear ~ variable, mean)

head(carsurvey,8)
```

###Exercise 3
<br>
This one is dealing with the airquality dataset.  He asks to use the melt function like in example one on the Month/Day date.

<br>

```{r}
head(airquality, 5)
```

<br>
```{r}
weathersurvey <- melt(airquality, id.vars = c("Month","Day"))

head(weathersurvey, 5)
```

###Example 4
<br>
Change the name of the Variable and Measurement Column.

Easy enough.  Just a couple new calls.

<br>
```{r}
weathersurvey2 <- melt(airquality, id.vars = c("Month","Day"), variable.name = "Condition", value.name = "Measurement")

head(weathersurvey2,4)
```

###Exercise 5
<br>
Use Dcast again on the weathersurvey.  Ok.  So this is pretty cool.  Basically on Month 5 Day 1 the Average Ozone was 41, etc.  This could be good for plotting in ggplot2 too.  

<br>
```{r}
airqualityedit <- dcast(weathersurvey2, Month + Day ~ Condition, value.var = "Measurement")

head(airqualityedit, 10)

```

###Exercise 9

<br>
I'm skipping to Exercise 9 because the other exercises deal with casting into matrices, which I don't use frequently.  

The question here is dealing with recasting back to the original.

<br>

```{r}
recast(mtcars, cyl + gear ~ variable, mean, id.var = c("cyl", "gear"))

```
###Exercise 10

<br>

Practice Recast function on airquality dataset.
```{r}
cast <- recast(airquality, Month + Day ~ variable, mean,  id.var = c("Month", "Day"))
head(cast, 5)
```
