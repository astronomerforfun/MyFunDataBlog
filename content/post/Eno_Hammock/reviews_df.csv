If you love hiking, camping, or just being in nature, it is a brilliant investment! Perfect for reading, homework, or just chilling! My only recommendation would be to bring a blanket to lay on if it's cold or windy as the thin (but strong) material makes it easy to get cold!

In the updated photos I have included you can see the new hammocks outside in a carport. Great place to test them sleeping externally while having close access to the home should they wish to go inside. Yes dear old dad slept outside with them. We even slept out side on xmas eve looking for Santa. Luckily he was smart enough to wait till they had fallen asleep. Which honestly took less time than there beds inside. Even with an outside temp in the 30'sWith the appropriate gear you can use your hammock year round. We do!Original :I absolutely love this/these hammocks. They have a wide range of colors to choose from. We purchased 4 over the last year. A single, Double and Double deluxe.The singles were for our kids and the double and deluxe were for the wife and myself. Truth be told I didn't realize I had a deluxe till after the purchase was complete. Oh well. I love the extra fabric of the double and the deluxe. The double safely held myself and my bouncy husky with no problem. One just bedded down and slept another well he wasn't having anything to do with it.We purchased the wall hanging mounts and setup ours for use while indoors too. What better way to introduce 2 kids to hammock-ing slowly. Lets just say they slept better in their hammocks than in their own rooms.I found out rather quickly why even a slow gentle breeze cools you down. So, we added in our sleeping bags and were toasty all night. Our next adventure the outdoor test with the kids. It will be their first outdoor sleeping. Heres hoping that goes well for this dad.When out doors I would highly recommend a set of ENO Eagles Nest Outfitters - Atlas Straps XL, Hammock Suspension System, Black. They are used to string the hammock between trees, its much easier than anything else like rope. I look forward to many years of continued use out of all our purchases.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFE4QMAUZOJ2P6WRJO3P2C65GNFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFE4QMAUZOJ2P6WRJO3P2C65GNFA"

I will always buy ENO before any other brand because of the quality and ease of setup. The only thing that I noticed on this particular hammock was the color faded quickly (not as bright as when I first purchased). Other than that I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a hammock. I actually slept in mine for 5 days when we went camping. 10 times better than a cot in a tent.UPDATE: Do not keep up outdoors 24/7 as this will shorten the life of the hammock. It will fade fast and will tear eventually if you keep it outdoors all the time in rain, sun, etc. It does state this on the manufacturer website. I wish it was weatherproof and would last a lifetime.

I got it for Father's Day and have used it several times over the past two weeks. It is easy to pack and easy to set up (you will need hammock straps to affix it to a tree ... I suggest Rallt straps which are the ones I purchased and have used successfully several times).  The hammock is plenty long and wide for me and would even be better for someone under 6 foot.  I fall asleep like a baby as soon as I stop hiking and fall into this cocoon. It's been fun to carry on our local (mtn) hiking trails and deploying out between two trees just off the trail.  I wish I had purchased this years ago to add to my hiking enjoyment. Get one ... you'll love it!

And really there is no need for me to have a bed right now. Because I don't have anybody to share it with. Anyways...this hammock is a must have!! It's very very comfortable!  I sleep in this hammock every night.  I don't nearly toss and turn as much as I did in a bed. I simply lay comfortably.  A hammock rocks you to sleep.  And my  cat loves it as well. Plenty of room for two to sit. Not to sleep. Unless you want your limbs to fall asleep. One problem I. Found is you get cold underneath. But I simply solved that with a mummy sleeping bag. After sleeping in this hammock for 12 days so far, I get a very good night's sleep. I recommend laying at a angle! As all YouTube reviews say. And I also plan using this on the beach. To buy the portable hammock frame simply go to these websites,- happytimeslife.com-eaglesnestoutfittersinc.comAt happy times life you can either buy just the frame or the combo frame and hammock. But you get to only choose 3 colors for combo.  My opinion ENO has way more colors. Double nest is a staff favorite.  In the package it's tightly packed in a carrying bag.  The bag is sort of sewn to the hammock so you won't loose the bag.ENO Comes with:-two carabiner-two stickers- No tree straps you will need to buy additional if attaching to trees",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGFY6RSSVDO6Z34KTS4VKRKPPPZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGFY6RSSVDO6Z34KTS4VKRKPPPZA"

      Orange/GreyPackage Type: Standard Packaging",3,"I purchased this product and immediately took it on a 2 night backpacking trip with a friend who has a Grand Trunk hammock which I had borrowed for a previous backpacking trip and slept in.  I expected this ENO hammock to be similar but it is considerably smaller and for that reason I do not like it.  I am 5'11"" and about 170 lbs. When I am in the Grand Trunk it will completely close around me.  It almost feels like a tent and there is no concern of falling out.  The ENO did not even come close to closing around me and I always feel some part of me is either hanging out or on the edge.  To be fair, since it was colder out, I placed a backpacking Thermarest EVO Lite air mattress under me to help provide insulation and this certainly contributed to the issue.I probably should have returned it but instead I kept it.  I will let my son use it since he is smaller and before my next trip I will purchase the Grand Trunk.The ENO does have good quality construction and worked flawlessly in every other way.  However, make sure you purchase the ENO Atlas straps which are fantastic.  Overall, I find sleeping in a hammock far more comfortable than a tent when backpacking if you expect to have trees to be able to hang it from.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGFUH5AGPYGTFBHTKCPHKGRLTUCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGFUH5AGPYGTFBHTKCPHKGRLTUCA"

      *Red/CharcoalPackage Type: Frustration-Free Packaging",5,"What can I say about the ENO DoubleNest Hammock?Well, in one phrase, I have honestly told people that it is easily on of my favorite purchases over the last several years.ENO makes some really nice and enjoyable products as I have come to discover.  I have since gone on to buy the Atlas Straps, the Pro Fly XL rain tarp, and the Guardian Bugnet, all very worth looking into as well.Well to begin this hammock as many nowadays, comes in a very small package when it is stored, probably about the size of two average sized fists.  Weird measurement I know, but they were what was in front of me and it's close enough!  It only takes about 5-7 minutes at most to set this hammock up, particularly if you have the Atlas straps or a similar hanging system.  It is also very comfortable and breathable for that great hammock feel, especially on a hot day.  The D-ring hooks that it hangs with a very convenient as well.  I wouldn't run off to climb with them, but they are rated at 400Ib between them and the rest of the implements.  This is rated for two people as well which is nice for those relaxing evenings at camp or on the trail.  It is as most have said fairly tight for two however so this is really a close friend or significant other type of situation.  Also, from an actual sleeping perspective, because of the nature of hammock sleeping and the somewhat restricted range of motion, I wouldn't really advise sharing the hammock with another person overnight.  It can certainly be done, but unless you're a very sound sleeper you may not stay very comfortable, especially with a sleeping bag or two in the hammock with you.Overall I love this hammock and the other accessories I have for it.  It can be a little pricey, but I don't mind spending a little bit more to support a company I really like.  I intend on buying one for my dad as a gift very soon.  Do yourself a favor and buy one to keep in the car, it takes up basically no room and you'll always be glad to pull it out in a pinch or for those on the spot times when you just need to do some lounging.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEJRU6F5TAQFB45YXTLPCADUT7UA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEJRU6F5TAQFB45YXTLPCADUT7UA"

      *Red/CharcoalPackage Type: Frustration-Free Packaging",3,"Look, ENO is great for getting people into hammocking by having huge availability, and simple suspension systems that anyone can understand.But no matter how you look at it, this is not at all worth the price you pay for it.For starters, the hammock is short. And I mean really short in comparison to standard double hammocks. At 9'4"", it is 12"" shorter than the 10'6"" Grand Trunk Double, and a whopping 20"" shorter than a standard 11' hammock by many cottage vendors such as Dutchware Gear. This may not sound like much of a difference, or you might think, ""hey, I'm short, I won't miss the extra length,"" but this simply isn't true. No matter how tall or short you are, you will notice and appreciate a longer hammock.Once properly hung at a 30 degree angle from the trees with proper sag (recommend adding a structural ridgeline for this), you will want to lay on a diagonal, no parallel/in-line with the hammock so you can sprawl out and practically lay flat in the hammock.This is where you will really feel the tension and small size of this hammock. Even when perfectly hung, I will get a kink in my neck after lying in this hammock long enough. It simply isn't big enough.So, for $70 retail price, you're getting less comfort, less material, and much heavier weight with no gain in strength when compared to a $43 11' Dutchware. In my opinion, you just shouldn't get this over a Dutchware. There is no benefit.Also, the Atlas Straps and cheaper alternatives...while easy, they are insanely heavy, and again, ENO is overpriced. Get a lightweight suspension system like the combination whoopie sling/marlin spike hitch/toggle system. You'll see online that this is what all the more experienced hammockers do.So basically, do some research, and very quickly you will see that this is not a good buy for the money.I appreciate that ENO gives hammocking some great exposure, but it uses its position to overprice for compromised products.Good luck, and happy hanging!",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHYHYCFYVB5L25TU4YYH7MFNIA7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHYHYCFYVB5L25TU4YYH7MFNIA7Q"

      *Red/CharcoalPackage Type: Frustration-Free Packaging",5,"The Eagles Nest Outfitters DoubleNest Hammock is great for someone who enjoys spending time outside and connecting with nature.  As long as you can find two trees that are close to each other, you can relax in this hammock all day long.The DoubleNest Hammock has several features that make it a worthwhile purchase.  First of all, Eagles Nest Outfitters hammocks are very durable; I bought this hammock 3 years ago and have used it over 100 times but it shows no signs of wear.  It has triple interlocking stitching which ensures that the hammock stays functional no matter how many times it is used. In addition, this hammock is made of nylon which is lightweight and soft making it the perfect place to lay all day or night. The DoubleNest hammock can hold up to 400 pounds, which is quite a lot considering it is only a very thin piece of material. Another great feature of this hammock is that it is large enough to fit two people comfortably, but it is also compact enough to travel with or throw in your backpack. Fully extended the hammock is over 9 feet long however, it can be compacted to only 5x4 inches. This hammock is able to roll up and fit inside a bag that is attached to the hammock; this is very convenient for storage purposes and the fact that the bag is attached ensures that you wont lose it, no matter how many adventures you embark upon. The DoubleNest Hammock also comes with carabineer attachments which make setting up your hammock quick and easy, no matter where you are.  You can also buy this product in a variety of colors which is great because you will be able to find one that fits your personal style.  This hammock can also be used for camping; the double hammock is especially great for sleeping because you are able to fold the hammock over yourself to stay warm, dry, and away from bugs.The one downside to this hammock is that it can be more expensive than other hammocks on the market.  However, I believe that you get what you pay for.  ENO is a great and well-known brand in the camping world and they make a very high quality product.Overall I highly recommend the Eagles Nest Outfitters DoubleNest Hammock.  If you love camping and hanging out outdoors you will not regret investing in this product.  The DoubleNest Hammock can take your outdoor adventure to the next level.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEWR2YEAZTMYHYN6MRUODJANDCNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEWR2YEAZTMYHYN6MRUODJANDCNQ"

      RastaPackage Type: Frustration-Free Packaging",5,"This thing is super quality. I've only had one other hammock in my life, and it was way too narrow to sleep in. This thing has some generous amount of room without the added weight. It's also ridiculously strong. I'm about 6' 1"", 225lbs and I don't ever get the familiar feeling that I'm going to pop a seam when I'm shifting my weight around in this thing. Fully stretching out is so comfy, it's wonderful. You can also have enough room to have 2 people in it, but I would say that 2 people sitting in it sideways is more ideal than laying in it (unless you're wanting to either get to know this person REALLY well, or perhaps start a small family). Set up is a cinch. You literally just wrap clip the carabiner into the pre-made rope loops and straps around the trees and you're good to go. I accidentally dropped it (while it was bundled) in the creek one evening and a dog almost grabbed it and ran off with it, but I was lucky enough to get it before he has had way with it. It definitely was wet, but once I opened it up ans shook it out, it dried in like a minute and a half. No big. The color is everything I wanted. It makes me think of Bob Marley, which is super cool for just chilling. I also found that there is enough material to wrap over yourself for a little added warmth and bug coverage.

I purchased the DoubleNest because I am 6'4"" and weight nearly 300 pounds, so I knew a single wouldn't work for me. I have had this nearly two years now and really haven't had any issues with it. I did replace the carabiners at the ends with more sturdy ones, so that brought some extra piece of mind. I purchased this in conjunction with Eno's Atlas straps to hang up with. Overall quality is great. The problem I have with it and the reason I deducted 1 star is price. Between this and the Atlas straps, I forked out nearly $100. I can find a hammock and strap kit for half that! I realize now that I could've gotten a much better deal, but at the time I just wanted to use the same brand my peers used.

I have never appreciated how much smart design and engineering went into the DoubleNest as when I was fighting to stay in my borrowed knock-off brand at three in the morning. The DoubleNest is ostensibly a simple product, with plain but durable lightweight materials and a seemingly normal attachment system. What you don't appreciate at first sight is how hard the ENO hammocks work to keep your tossing and turning self from flipping the hammock over while you sleep. The build quality in ENO gear is top of the class, and take down and set up are easy with a little practice. I will say, however, that the 'Double' in DoubleNest is very much up to interpretation. If you aren't an exceptionally cuddly person, you'll probably want your own hammock.

I still really do like my hammock and so I went out and got climbing grade carbiners, something I can really trust. I emailed ENO about this and I didn't feel like they handled it well telling me that I didn't close the carbiner or set it up properly. If they want to be a top brand for hammocks they should be using higher quality carbiners. So my trust has been lost really and I'm slowly looking to get different straps and eventually a new hammock as well.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEEC3NBJRML5LCTW7HIAW2ER36TA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEEC3NBJRML5LCTW7HIAW2ER36TA"

It seemed too good to be true that there was a portable hammock for a cheap reasonable price with such rave reviews. I decided to purchase an Eno in one of the many color options. It shipped to me very fast. When I first received it, the set up confused me, but a brief tutorial made it very easy to understand. This hammock changed my life. It literally could be set up anywhere in the world as long as it was secured properly. I could bring it to the park, around my house, to school, honestly anywhere.

      Khaki/OlivePackage Type: Frustration-Free Packaging",3,"YOU CANNOT BE COMFORTABLE WITH TWO PEOPLE IN THIS HAMMOCK. My issue with eno is that the ""double nest"" is not remotely large enough for two normal sized human beings. When you attempt to get in w another person it's an awkward mess of butting knees and accidental copping of feels. This fact makes me question how ridiculously small a ""single nest"" could be. To add insult to injury, the stuff sack that attaches to the side of the hammock ripped off after a few weeks of relatively heavy use. But there are good things about eno. I love their straps, really easy to set up, conveniently long, and undoubtedly strong. The carabineers on each end seem cleverly engineered and quite strong as well. It's ironic that the only part this hammock company got wrong was the actual hammock... When you want to buy a hammock eno is the first brand you hear of. Everyone has one. I believe this is because they were the first or one of the first to manufacture parachute material hammocks. I'm no internet complainer but it makes me mad when I pay a lotta money for a mediocre product. The hype of the company doesn't live up to its standard nor justify the price point of their products.

For the most part it remained inside my home with my hiking gear, away from the elements.Recently I went camping and brought the hammock along in lieu of a camp chair. I weigh about 195lbs, and am well within the weight limits for the hammock. I set it up at our campsite and, as soon as i sat, the main seam in the fabric split dropping me through the middle of the hammock. Boy was I pissed that I had to hike all the way out of the woods to go home.I wouldn't trust this hammock on long trips, and I strongly suggest that you don't either. It might stand up to casual use, but is nowhere near well-made enough to take a beating.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEHRFXXPZ5Y4QFIY3IKLLNL2557A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEHRFXXPZ5Y4QFIY3IKLLNL2557A"

On less-than-perfect days, such as early November with light wind gusts, we still had peace.  Gotta love that.This year it seems I'll need to order another hammock.  Teenagers want to use it.  I guess they need peace, too.True story:  Forty years ago I went to sea on a sailing ship with hammocks.  Then, as now, the hammock was a very private place, even in a public space like a berthing area or a park.  This DoubleNest hammock is easier to pitch than the sailing ship version.  More comfortable in many ways, too.Tree straps made set-up easy.  I had good results with IMPROVED Super-Lightweight Hammock Tree Straps. Ends ALL Your Hammock Set Up Problems.

My husband and I each have a double now and even though we CAN obviously fit in a double together it's much more comfy to each have our own (especially with me being 7.5 months pregnant!), and then we can pull the sides in and snuggle up inside as well. I love that these hammocks come with their own attached stuff sack (can't lose it!), and while they're maybe a bit too heavy for bringing on long/overnight hikes when you're trying to watch your pack weight, they're awesome for day trips or car camping.

      Forest/CharcoalPackage Type: Frustration-Free Packaging",5,"To preface this, I am a minimalist backpacker/camper. Considering this hammock is double nested, it does compact fairly small and it decently lightweight. If you're going the route of using a hammock instead of a tent, it is important to realize that a good, lightweight tent will weigh less than a hammock setup (including tarp and suspension system.) The hammock setup mostly exists to provide you the freedom of choice to sleep comfortably above the ground, and with clear skies, a lovely, unobstructed view to fall asleep to, as well as a casual way to rest and relax during the day. This hammock serves those purposes wonderfully.As far as using it for two people, prepare to be close. A double nested hammock is not meant for a couple that gets hot and stuffy and cramped in the middle of the night. If you're a couple that likes to cuddle, and are a bit on the smaller side, then I think you'll find this hammock to suit your needs both wonderfully and comfortably as my boyfriend and I did. As a single person hammock, it does provide great protection from bugs and it's extra comfy and roomy. As with all hammocks, I suggest having something underneath you on cooler nights to protect from the under draft, and it also helps with keeping away mosquitos. This material is light and breathable, so they will bite you if unexposed skin is pressed against the hammock.For what it was made for, this hammock does the job, and it remains a permanent part of my camping gear.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGZ3ENTUGU3GLIDBYYFFF2BZL5YA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGZ3ENTUGU3GLIDBYYFFF2BZL5YA"

I'm not a small person at 5' 10"" and 230 lbs and I have not experienced even one instance of ripping or fraying. So unless you're deliberately trying to tear the fabric it isn't going to happen.

It is also a wonderful addition to my backyard and the campus where I go to school. The hammock is easy to hang up, lightweight, and sturdy.

      *Red/CharcoalPackage Type: Standard Packaging",5,"I'm an avid camper but have never really liked the idea of sleeping exposed to elements and have always instead elected for a tent. However, as I've gotten older, my back problems (scoliosis) have increased and sleeping on the ground inside a tent has been more and more troublesome, even with an air mattress. My wife finally had enough of my groaning in the morning and decided to buy us this hammock. I was pretty skeptical but after one night of sleeping in it, I'm hooked. I'll never sleep on the ground again. Now, admittedly, I can't compare this with other hammocks as this is the only one I've owned. However, I will say that I can't imagine them being much better. She and I can both easily fit in it and cuddle together as there is more than enough fabric to contain us both. Combined, we actually exceed the 400 lb limit by a bit. I'm a bit on the heavier side. Yet it still holds up with no problem at all. I've been using it for over a year now and love it. Additionally, there's enough extra material that if I'm sleeping in it solo, I can wrap the remainder over the top of me and ""cocoon"" myself. This was particularly helpful on a dewy morning last weekend. I awoke to a wet hammock and a dry sleeping bag. Love it.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGNFX3JKPIA2EP7KWIC7BOUH2WSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGNFX3JKPIA2EP7KWIC7BOUH2WSA"

      Teal/KhakiPackage Type: Frustration-Free Packaging",5,"I have had my ENO Double nest for SEVEN YEARS. That is seven years of packing, unpacking, toting, Stretching, scrambling in and out with cats and dogs and sharp pens/pencils from studying during college. This hammock will NOT disappoint. While it is a bit pricey, divide by at least seven and look at what you're spending for every year's worth of gorgeous days and camping, hiking, backyard relaxing or park playing.For campers: I suggest getting the double nest even if you will be the only one using it. You will be able to place something heavy in the packing pocket attached on the side, swing it over across yourself and have a good amount of ""cocoon"" room to keep bugs off or feel less exposed even when under netting or tarps.For hikers: LIGHTWEIGHT! Same tips apply. Just a little extra weight and you can fit two people for a break along the trail, or sleeping. Double is the way to go!For Backyard adventurers: This is a great option for ""lawn furniture"" when you have backyard parties and cookouts. Comfy for the Sunday nap, reading with littles and cuddling your furbaby in the shade. Get the straps specially made for hammock hanging and set up is a cinch!Park Players: My only advice is to bring it , but KNOW YOUR PARKS. Some places will not allow you to hang these up because of possible damage to trees. I have heard some will let you know if they are welcome, others won't  and some will allow you to hang them but only with some kind of cloth underneath the strap to prevent bark stripping. This only requires a phone call or asking the ranger station.Looking for a graduation gift for your future college student?Want something unique for your out-door loving Mom or Dad for mother's day and father's day?Are you and your spouse looking to spend more time together on the trail?Want to make special memories with the kids?This hammock is one of the few things you can get without any buyers remorse.*** I did not receive any benefits for writing this review, that's how much I love ENOS!!! ***",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHMVK2APEXGI6CZ3MYV5CSLTCU6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHMVK2APEXGI6CZ3MYV5CSLTCU6Q"

When I opened it, the hammock was packed down very small and I thought wow this thing is no very big. I opened it up and set it up(with mallome straps, I highly recommend) and was amazed at the ease of use. The included carabineers are very nice and hold up to 400 lbs(181 kg). The hammock is sewed into the bag so that you never lose it and believe it or not the hammock easily packs down back into the bag. It takes a little practice to learn how to lay in it comfortably and I have laid in this hammock for 3 hours at a time so far and had no back, neck, or leg pain. I plan to camp for 5 nights with this on memorial day 2016. I find the best part of this is to store your gear in the included pouch and then lay it over the other side of the hammock creating a great cocoon effect and you stay cozy and comfortable.Pros:Rich colorhigh weight capacityquality hardware includedsewn in compression bagdouble nest is very adequate to hold 2 peoplecomfortablelight weightCons:takes a little practice to get just rightI would definitely buy another one and highly recommend",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHRBN6PLLGTSUUSN5ZB52IWOC5IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHRBN6PLLGTSUUSN5ZB52IWOC5IQ"

I'm 5'10 and weigh 290 lbs and I can sleep in this comfortably. My only issue with these hammocks is that they don't include some kind of basic straps nor cordage for hanging. For the price if you were to walk into any retailer that had these it's a great deal and you come out ahead. However, with just five minutes of basic search on Amazons site one can find a multitude of other brands that both straps and hammock can be bought for the same price as this ENO. Is it worth the money, sure thing, it's a great value. But I'd like to see ENO step up the game, and include a basic hanging system in the same package for the same price. As an example I spent 6 bucks at my local provider of 550 paracord and made two 12ft straps in about 30 minutes. Final thought Eno's Hammocks are a buy, especially if you are a first time hammock user and want to see if you like it.

I have so much fun finding new spots to hang it from and its awesome to take hiking for a quick nap or break.  Over the summer I slept in it multiple times while camping. It's extra comfy with a pillow. You definitely should invest in the Atlas XL straps so you can hang it almost anywhere. Get the right amount of sag and you'll never want to get out of this hammock. I look forward to some more lazy spring and summer days in it even though I've steadily used it throughout the winter for some snow hammocking near frozen lakes.

      Orange/GreyPackage Type: Frustration-Free Packaging",5,"Im a professional power lounger with over 40 years of experience under my belt.  This was the very first portable power lounger that I bought.  Its small and light weight and fits easily into my backpack without taking up a lot of space.SIZE:  Yes size does matter.  Im 5'10"" tall and 220 lbs.  I prefer the extra space that this double size offers.  It allows for plenty of room to add a sleeping mat and sleeping bag.  I can also pull the sides over the top to have a cocoon type of effect which is nice for shading the sun.  I can also roll over and curl up my knees for side sleeping.  Sometimes I even sit up in the hammock with my feet hanging out (like sitting on a couch) and pull the back side up for neck and head support.WARMTH:  This breathes, therefore its not warm.  I add a sleeping pad and a sleeping bag.  A sleeping bag alone is not enough because the loft gets compressed causing it to lose its effectiveness.  The ultimate would be a hammock quilt attached to the outside of the hammock, but those are expensive (note to self:  add to wish list).STRENGTH:  Plenty strong enough for me at 220.  The wife and I can both fit in this, but its not as comfortable as each having our own.  Plus she snores <U+0001F634><U+0001F4A4> <U+0001F4A4>and then blames it on me<U+0001F644>.HANGING:  Hanging is super easy IF you have hammock straps, which I HIGHLY recommend.

I recommend buying the cheaper competitor version that includes straps and saving yourself $30. These are also made in Vietnam, same location as the competitors so once again not sure where the price increase is derived from.  It is so much smaller in comparison that I thought maybe they had sent me the wrong one... then I saw it clearly states on the product that its the DoubleNest....The Hammock itself appears to be well made, no problems or issues, The smaller size I feel did make it less comfortable then the competitor, to the point my wife decided after trying we would never both sit in this one again and simply use the other one.

Even though it was only 35 degrees outside, my daughter set it up and took a warm blanket with her to enjoy trying it out. Super easy to set up, strong and durable fabric, awesome colors, and balls up in it's own built in pouch that takes up less room in an overnight bag than a hooded sweatshirt. It should be noted that these hammocks do not come with the strap system needed for hanging it, so remember to order your straps! We used the Heavy Duty Extra Long Hang Tight Hammock System straps from Nature's Hangout. They are much better than some of the Atlas straps used by ENO and have far more loops to get the perfect height. Overall I love this product and can't wait to take it beyond our backyard as we travel.

Using the straps made hooking up the hammock to trees a lot easier. Just make sure you find two trees that are sturdy and the right distance apart.Not many people review this product from a first timer's point of view, so make sure you watch a few videos on how to properly set up a hammock before use. It is very easy to use.Comfortability was so good that we both almost fell asleep. With two people in the hammock, the extra material that would normally cover one person is not there, so bring some sleeping bags or blankets. Wind does blow through it, but a sleeping bag would get rid of that issue.Overall, my husband absolutely loves his gift, and we will go back out to camp with it soon. :) Highly recommend.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGZ7FWWYJXDVTXRYLXLSCMXCBMCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGZ7FWWYJXDVTXRYLXLSCMXCBMCQ"

      Royal/EmeraldPackage Type: Standard Packaging",5,"I'm 5'3 120lb female and I was debating between the single or the doublenest hammock. I read through reviews and looked at videos online and most were given by males over 5'10+ in the 150-180lb range; needless to say, I was skeptical how accurate their reviews would be with respect to my size and stature.The biggest concern I had was that the singlenest would be too small and unfavorable with company, and that the doublenest would wrapped me up like a burrito.I ended up buying the doublenest and it is great!! Very roomy and comfortable. It does create a burrito effect if I were to lay straight parallel in the hammock with my arms by my side, but since that's an awkward position anyway, I didn't have to worry about getting swallowed up. I prefer lying at an angle (stretching the fabric out wider rather than having it tunnel over me) or having my arms out bracketing the side of the hammock.If you're still not convinced, just remember that the doublenest is intended for two people! So just shell out the extra $10 bucks or so (which is nothing) and get the double and you can invite your friends to hang in your hammock with you!I set up my doublenest for the first time today at a park and got complimented by three passerby and a ton of smiles from people checking out the hammock!

      Black/BlackPackage Type: Standard Packaging",5,"ENO DoubleNest HammockI bought my Eagles Nest Outfitters (ENO) DoubleNest Hammock in December of 2014. I am very impressed with the product, as it tailors to camping needs and leisure time. If you’re looking to camp and sleep with your hammock, or just to use it around home, this product is very practical and durable.While using this product I noticed that it was very durable. All of the seams are triple stitched, and don’t bulge or tare when you have two people in it. There are three sections of fabric that you lay on all connected by this stitching. The sectioning will allow the weight to be allocated to each set of stitches, and also let you wrap or “cocoon” yourself up for shade.ENO’s website says that you can put up to 400 pounds of pressure on the fabric. Though this is a rough estimate, I have been able to put nearly 500 pounds without any effect. The price of the product reflects the durability, as it is on the higher side. If you’re looking for something simpler, a cheaper style of these hammocks may serve you well too.One of the best things about the product is its portability. You will be able to carry around the bag anywhere in preparation of setting it up. When in the bag, the hammock is about the size of a large grapefruit, allowing you to easily place it, or clip it to a backpack.The lightweight fabric is very beneficial when you are looking to have a light load for camping. Instead of carrying and setting up a tent, popping your hammock up to sleep will serve as an easy alternative. When sleeping in the hammock it may be hard to get used to the hanging sensation, but it will take a large amount of stress off of your spine and joints. Which is great for when you don’t want to wake up sore after a night of camping.I hope you were able to find this review on the Eagles Nest Outfitters DoubleNest Hammock helpful on your search for a new product.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF7K5KSR6HTVV5AOEWFBKJWHP5KA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AF7K5KSR6HTVV5AOEWFBKJWHP5KA"

      *Red/CharcoalPackage Type: Frustration-Free Packaging",5,"The ENO Double Nest Hammock is built with an active outdoor person’s needs in mind. It is ideal for anyone who is looking for an effortless, and reliable product for sleeping outside. The hammock is durable, and comfortable. It is also very quick and easy to set up, and packs away nicely into any backpack or bag.All of ENO’s products are extremely durable and long lasting. The hammock itself can hold up to 400 lbs., and the seams have been triple stitched for maximum durability. The hammock comes with climbing style aluminum wire-gate carabineers, which are connected to the hammock by nautical grade line. Overall, this hammock is as strong and reliable as it gets.Comfort is definitely something that you need to consider when purchasing a product that you are going to sleep in, and the ENO Double Nest Hammock will surely meet your needs. It is made up of a breathable, and quick drying nylon that will maintain its shape and conform to your body. If you are a side sleeper, like me, you will find that this hammock may even be more comfortable than a standard sleeping pad on the ground. If you are looking to use the hammock in cooler temperatures, the hammock is wide enough to hold a sleeping pad for more insulation.You will need to buy the suspension system in order to hang the hammock up. However, this enables you to choose the straps that best fit your needs when it comes to size. For example, if you are going to be using this hammock in an area with larger trees, such as the Redwoods, you may want to purchase the corresponding XL Straps. Whereas if you are in the Midwest where the trees are smaller, the regular straps will do the trick.If you decide to enhance your outdoor experiences by investing in the ENO Double Nest Hammock, you will surely be satisfied with the durability and comfort it will provide.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGJGJJ2KH6WZBLJ2NAFH773FWNFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGJGJJ2KH6WZBLJ2NAFH773FWNFA"
"1444","B01GTP417C","Great Hammock","Allison Myers",2015-09-25,0,"
      *Red/CharcoalPackage Type: Frustration-Free Packaging",5,"This hammock is great no matter what you’re going to use it for-camping, reading, or traveling. I have taken it with me on a number of trips and have used it at home as well. It scrunches up to a surprisingly small size when trying to pack it into a duffel or suitcase, and the bag provided for the hammock is lightweight and thin so as not to add any extra weight or volume to your luggage. The straps also come with their own bag allowing them to be neatly packed away but separate from the hammock.The hammock is super easy to set up- I have hung it in a variety of places by myself with no issues. One issue is that the LONG STRAPS do still have their limitations. I had debated ordering with the REGULAR STRAPS OR THE LONG STRAPS, but am very glad I picked the latter. They do well with small to medium sized trees, but I wish they were a bit longer to accommodate trees with larger trunks or a slightly larger gap between two trees. The straps are also adjustable, so if the gap is smaller, there is no need to worry about a hammock that sits too low. That being said, the LONG STRAPS are definitely worth the extra money.Using the hammock has been great so far. It comes with me on most trips whether that’s camping in the Upper Peninsula (where it not only provides a place to sleep outside of the tent, but also just a nice place to relax and read) or while living in Europe for a semester. When studying abroad, I had limited space in my luggage to bring extra non-essential items, but since it packs into a really small and light bag, it took very little space in my suitcase. On many occasions, I was very happy I had it with me to escape the bustle of Rome by taking it to a park for an afternoon of relaxing.The hammock’s quality is great. I have had it a year and used it a number of times, yet it has not developed any tears or scuffs. It’s surprisingly strong for how thin it is. Not only do two people comfortably fit inside, it does not seem to strain at all. Even my 70 pound dog has enjoyed the hammock!Overall, I highly recommend the hammock. It’s light, portable, easily set up, and durable. I also highly recommend that anyone buy it with the LONG STRAPS, and my only complaint is that I wish they were even just a bit longer.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AECOS7RA47XEUHIXUSVQ756376KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AECOS7RA47XEUHIXUSVQ756376KQ"

When the hammock is set up, the bag hangs off to the side, so you can use it to hold things like your phone or a book. The parachute-like material is strong and durable, and I have had no tears or loose threads in 3+ years of use. Carabiners on the ends can attach easily to either the ""slap straps"" also made by ENO or a rope with well-tied knots. When two people sit in the hammock at ones, they do tend to slide toward the middle, but once you find a comfortable position, you won't want to get out.

Also, because of the extra fabric, when I am hammocking alone, I can wrap myself up in it, and it's quite cozy!  The ENO packs up into its very small package easily, and goes up easily, as well.  I purchased the Atlas Straps, and have been very pleased with them, although I use my ENO mainly for recreation, not really for camping out.

I went ahead and purchased the Guardian bugnet and I'm glad I did, my next purchase will be the tarp. This hammock has alot of extra material since it's built for two people  and I can lay inside of it and wrap the extra over me, I could have gone with the singlenest and been just fine either way the doublenest is rated up to 400 lbs.

      Navy/ForestPackage Type: Frustration-Free Packaging",5,"Great hammock, alone or with a friend!NOTE:  In my case, I did not need straps as the carabiners latched onto the railing of my balcony, but be aware that the hammock does not come with straps.I bought this hammock for the balcony of my apartment. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the item. It is made of a very light yet strong material that makes it perfect for summer use. On cool days, you'll need a blanket or sleeping bag to insulate the bottom from wind as it can get quite chilly. When laying in the hammock alone, the excess material can be used to ""cocoon"" yourself in which goes a long way in blocking out direct sunlight or wind. When laying tandem, you won't be squashed against your partner as you might in other hammocks. There's plenty of room for closeness without either person being crushedI highly recommend this hammock.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGRZOL2G4VKYOWPWJVGZU4GTY4OQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGRZOL2G4VKYOWPWJVGZU4GTY4OQ"

At first I purchased this product and planned on tying it up with paracord but that turned out to be too much of a hassle for me. I then latter went to a sporting goods store and picked up a set of ENO's nylon straps with pre-stitched loops. This makes setting up my hammock a process that takes about 2 minutes tops. Speaking of convenience this hammock really does fit into the pouch easily when packing up and it is roughly the size of a grapefruit. I don't really have anything negative to say about the product. The only thing is, is that if you are going to use this in cooler weather conditions you will want to bring a sleeping bag or blankets because there is no insulation in the hammock.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFKFWXEKJ3SNUPRA7JP5SYQRL3LQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFKFWXEKJ3SNUPRA7JP5SYQRL3LQ"

I ordered the Olive/Khaki double nest and it is amazing. The color is great and I might take it hunting, you could use this in a big enough deer stand, and will do well to blend in. If you don't have one of these you need to get one.

My friends and I are planning a 6 day 72mile camping trip, and I was looking into something other than a heavy sleeping bag and tent. So my best friend how is pretty much me in male form, said ""Im taking my camping hammock. You should look into it."" So since I can fall sleep pretty much anywere including on concrete and me in male form can sleep in one I looked into it. Oh my friend also suggested getting a bright one because it would be easier to see in the dark on those nights I've had a few too many drinks.After hours of research and asking around I finally settled on this one. Got it in the mail really quickly! And of course the first thing I did was open it. And bright is an understatement! I got the retro trip color, (the yellow, blue and pink).My first time using it was awesome. It really glowed in the dark and it was so comfortable I hat my bed now.

While the authentic ENO hammock is over double the price, it is money well spent.The material and workmanship seem top-of-the-line-quality. No complaints there.If you are debating, as I was, whether to get suspension straps, my advice is definitely do it. You will be thankful later when its dark and you can get this setup in a matter of seconds. The straps make setup a breeze. I before I purchased the straps and the ENO hammock, I set up a yarn hammock with rope and t was a big hassel. These straps let you adjust distance easily.The bottom line - definitely worth it.

      *Red/CharcoalPackage Type: Frustration-Free Packaging",5,"This is one of the most popular camping hammocks because of its quality and price.  I have always found the ""double"" hammock idea to be a little bit of a joke.  It is fine for lounging, but there is no way you could sleep comfortably with someone else.  The good part of double hammocks is that they offer more room for sleeping.  It is easier to fit a sleeping pad and sleeping bag in a double that a single, if that is the way you go.  Pretty much all camping hammocks pack down to the same size, and at 20 oz, it is pretty light.  Because this is parachute nylon, they are a little more susceptible to tearing than some of the other camping hammocks made of stronger ripstop material.  The material is why this hammock is less expensive than some camping hammocks out there, but this is on the expensive side of parachute hammocks.  The carabiners that are included are really good quality.So, the short version, if you want a really good quality, relatively low priced hammock, this is a great way to go.  There are better options out there, but unless you are an experiences hammock camper, and know exactly what your gear requirements are, this hammock will do you just fine.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFMZGGB3HFJIBX2M4BTHTXW3ESWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFMZGGB3HFJIBX2M4BTHTXW3ESWA"

      Emerald/KhakiPackage Type: Standard Packaging",4,"Let me just start out by saying that this hammock is AMAZING. I have used it several times, and it is very comfortable. It takes me less than 5 minutes to set it up in combination with the Atlas straps. I have seen other reviews that state how it is annoying that the flaps (sides) fall down in your face when laying down. That is correct, if you are laying in the double-nest in the traditional head-to-foot length-ways as a single (not so large) person the flaps will fall down on you. But I use this hammock to stretch all the way out. I lay in it diagonally, I can even almost completely lay out from side to side in it. If you want to just lay in your hammock in a traditional way, I recommend the single-nest instead.The only reason I have given this 4 stars is because the color in the picture does not match the color I received. The description says ""emerald/khaki"" but the picture looks almost greyish and turquoise. The actual color that came was a dark khaki with a emerald green trim. So pay more attention to what colors they say it is, then the color the photo shows. Either way I liked those colors just as well so I kept it. I would highly recommend this product!",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE36XWYZXFXKGCJFZTP53J3CO72A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AE36XWYZXFXKGCJFZTP53J3CO72A"

Needless to say this is solid.My setup:2x 6-12ft of polyester webbing (300ft roll for like $15 on Ebay)2x Amsteel Whoopie slings ($20 around the web)2x Climbing wire gate carabiners ($3-5 per on Amazon)1x ENO DoubleNestUse sling to replace the rope on the ENO, attach carabiner to adjustable loop in sling, put a single end loop in webbing and wrap around tree, use a carabiner in a marlin spike hitch.

If you are unfamiliar with this product I would suggest doing more research about this product because it is a pricy item, but worth every penny. I love being able to hammock with friends, and this is perfect for sleeping, hanging out, and relaxing.The fabric is sturdy, and the stitches are strong. The clip that connects the hammock to what ever your suspension system is feels a little weak, but has not caused any issues and is non the less reliable too. I would recommend buying the Eagles Nest Outfitters Atlas Straps to hang your hammock.

      Khaki/OlivePackage Type: Standard Packaging",4,"The Eno DoubleNest is nothing revolutionary. There are a growing number of companies that make camping hammocks, and twice as many individuals who make their own. Hennessey Hammocks, Warbonnet, Grand Trunk, and Hammock Bliss, just to name a few. With that being said, it is a very good camping hammock.By itself, the DoubleNest is very spacious and very comfortable. I bought my fiancee and myself one when we first started camping. We chose the DoubleNest because we were both a bit heavier at the time. As a standalone hammock, the DoubleNest has everything you need. It's durable; mine are still going strong after two years. It's easy to set up, with the two ""slap straps"" to hug the tree's and the simple carabiner attachment to clip on to the straps. You could probably do it well in under a minute.When I first bought it, the slap straps had a great deal of sag to them, often requiring a reset after laying in the hammock for an hour. I bought some upgraded Atlas straps that fixed this problem, though.This issue with the ENO DoubleNest actually comes into play later on down the road. After you've hit a nasty rainstorm, or a swarm of mosquitos. The bugnet and rainfly go together well with the DoubleNest, but... not very quickly. Most of the rainflys are also not entirely big enough to offer true protection from the elements either. I actually upgraded to a Hennessey after a nice rainshower two nights ago kept splattering on me under the tarp. Additionally, you almost need another ridgeline for the tarp, and then another one for the bugnet, although I'd imagine you can probably clip the bugnet onto the tarp as well. The bugnet also hangs a bit loose, and can result in things like stepping out onto it and snapping one of the clips in half.All told, it's a great hammock, but as a hammock system for inclement weather, and inclement bugs, setting it up can be a real hassle. Taking it down, it goes without saying, can be one as well. I'd recommend it to anyone, it's a good system. I simply think there are probably better systems for around the same ""total"" money out there as well.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AETGZKV4UTV6QCXX2UCNTA7JDLRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AETGZKV4UTV6QCXX2UCNTA7JDLRA"

      Khaki/BlackPackage Type: Standard Packaging",5,"I bought this to use as my bed in my small dwelling. Not only does it fit the bill for a compact sleeping solution, it also provides for the most comfortable bed I've ever had. Once installed, I can set it up at night in about 10 seconds. In the morning I unhook one end and roll it up to the other end where it stays out of the way until needed. I set it up so the ""foot"" is attached to a wall where I have a shelf unit so the rolled hammock, a pillow and blanket store right there on the shelf out of harms way. Hanging a hammock requires a little thought and experimentation. There's an on-line hammock calculator which is great for getting started. It's at:  <<< http://theultimatehang.com/hammock-hang-calculator.html >>>  I started with that and over a couple of nights made some minor adjustments and now life is good. NEVER buy a hammock with spreaders! They are uncomfortable and require the skills of an acrobat. A proper hammock automatically provides the exact right support for every part of your body. It nestles you in and feels snug but not restrictive. On a mattress I tend to be a side sleeper. I can sleep on my side in this hammock but it actually feels more comfortable to be on my back. And speaking of backs, I have had a long history of periodic back strain. Comes and goes but how quickly it clears up depends on the nature of the bed I'm using. I actually had a bit of a strain at the time I started using this hammock. Had been going on for about 6 weeks. The morning after my first night in this hammock and my back ache was gone and has not returned. A properly hung hammock of this design just provides the most natural sleeping platform there is. It also inhibits tossing and turning which reduces the effects of a ""restless nights sleep"" . It has never taken me more than 15 minutes to fall asleep once I started hammock sleeping. It is just so relaxing! I chose this model based on the weight rating of about 400 pounds. I don't weigh close to that but figured for full-time use 365 days a year I wanted that robustness due to wear and tear. The first couple of times I ""mounted"" the hammock, I did hear some light tearing sounds.

      Khaki/OlivePackage Type: Standard Packaging",5,"I can't speak highly enough of this hammock, approaching 4 years of use and has suffered some expected wear - mainly the little pack that houses the entire hammock is no longer attached, but that hasn't caused any problems.Almost every time I use this hammock I receive compliments and questions pertaining to the acquisition of such a luxury.Was amazing for days of school when I had a little more time between classes than I preferred. Myself and a handful of friends actually started a ""trend"" of lounging in hammocks on campus between classes. Makes for great ""hang out"" sessions - pun intended. Takes 2 minutes to set up and less time to take down. I've comfortably slept in this hammock both during naps and overnight camping trips. When it gets too cold it easily fits a sleeping bag.I'm a 200lb, bearded man, and at times this champion of a hammock has easily borne the weight of myself and two 100lb females, myself and an excited 90lb boxer dog that at a full sprint leaped into the hammock while I was relaxing in it, and myself and a male of greater weight than I.Although I do not recommend the following - I have left the hammock outside during multiple thunderstorms. It has endured smoking sessions from an UN-welcomed friend of my sibling and I have never needed to clean it beyond wiping it down with a towel after my nephew had a slobber-fit in it.If you're struggling making a decision on whether or not to purchase this hammock, I would highly recommend purchasing it. Upon my first use, all of the lingering doubts of whether this was a wise purchase were slain. Wait for a great day of weather, set this hammock up, then equip yourself with a sandwich and cold cerveza and all of your doubts will, too, be slain.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEXVSMIL2EHZQKKBYF4WVIHB2ULQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEXVSMIL2EHZQKKBYF4WVIHB2ULQ"

There are never any achy camp mornings anymore. I wake up refreshed and ready to go. The double is worth the money, too, so the sun doesn't burn out your eyes or face in the morning. You can just pull the hammock around you like you're in a pea pod. The attached stuff sack is handy for your glasses, keys, meds, whatever you might need in the night. Although, If you're going to get serious, then I can't recommend the eno rain fly or bug net. Its just too expensive with too many components. They pack down small, sure, but I'd rather have the hammock bliss sky tent 2. Its a one-piece, double decker rain fly/bug net combo. Two hammocks can fit in this thing stacked, and is easy to set up with attached guy and ridge lines. It even has some guy lines that pull the bug net out away from you so its nice and roomy in there, even with two people. All you need to complete the set is some Eno twilights.

      *Red/CharcoalPackage Type: Standard Packaging",4,"I purchased the DoubleNest for myself after seeing a video review of a guy comparing the Double and Single for one person. The DoubleNest seemed to be more comfortable with all the extra room, however in retrospect the man reviewing was a fairly large guy. He said he was 6'3 and 220 pounds, so if you are around this same size I imagine the DoubleNest would be more of a suitable fit. However, I am 5'11 and 165 pounds and personally I found the DoubleNest a little less comfortable than a SingleNest was. If I laid in certain ways I could get comfortable, but even then it had to be perfect and plus since it's designed to fit two people when you lay vertically in it the ends of the hammock are very high up and I couldn't see over them unless they were pulled down.However, for two people it's great. It fully supports the weight of two people with no problems at all. It may be a little nerve racking at first but you can trust it. I would only see this product for either a married or dating couple, as the two people in the hammock will be VERY close together.

Plus, this hammock is very easy to pack up after each use--it takes me less than two minutes to set it up or put it away, so it stays much cleaner than my rope hammock did.Although this is a double hammock, the two people sharing would have to be either very small people or very OK with the idea of cuddling with each other because, unlike a bed, there's no way for one person to be one one side of the hammock while the second person gets the other side.  The instructions say that the hammock has a weight limit of 400 pounds, and the fabric is so lightweight that I would hesitate to get very close to that limit. I enjoy using this hammock alone and using the excess ""double sized"" fabric like a sheet or blanket.  I fold it over myself and get comfy, and the extra fabric keeps me cozy and also servers as a barrier against insects.  Because of this, I would recommend the double sized hammock even to singletons who don't intend to use the hammock with another person.  The only reason that I could see to get the single sized hammock would be to save size and weight if you were being really careful about what you are packing for a backpacking trip or something like that.  I use the hammock for lounging in the backyard while I nap or read, so I haven't given much consideration to its use as a piece of backpacking or camping gear.I would highly recommend this hammock.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFNXIR2NFOQDESLSQF7P4RFAIXSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFNXIR2NFOQDESLSQF7P4RFAIXSA"

Design and materials are first rate.This double sized hammock really does fit two adults comfortably, and you can throw a small child or dog or two in as well.It packs up and compresses into its own sewn-on attached pocket for travel.The material feels like parachute silk, strong yet soft to the touch. It feels...luxurious.These are amazingly comfortable. Easy to fall asleep in. If bugs aren't a concern you could sleep all night in this.It's also extremely durable. It's extremely resistant to mildew and it won't rot. Water and humidity have no effect on it.I've had several ENOs for years and they're still like new. Stitching, sewing, materials, all that is first rate. No complaints whatsoever. Reasonably priced, and money well spent.Note: ENO does not usually include rope, so you'll need your own. Polyester does not stretch & is a better choice than nylon rope. There's a range of good 'tree straps' that are easy, fast and good for the tree's trunk, such as the ENO Atlas Straps.I love this hammock.

This hammock allows for a lot of wriggle room.  I had zero issues with it.  The included caribiners are more than adequate and it packs away easily.  I'm impressed.  I had a bit of wind at 32 degrees one of the nights.  The nice advantage of having extra material was that it helped block the breeze from under my tarp.

I could easily sleep in it but most of the time I just rest my back which is a total mess.

I've already spent more time the last two months in the ENO than I did the entire life of the Hatteras. Because it's so compact and you can attach it with a couple of lengths of paracord, I've even thrown it in my weekend-trip backpack (i.e. 12-15Ls)/carry-on and set it up where ever I ended up. I'm not sure if its the paracord or the hammock, or just my fat butt, but after a few minutes it definitely sags a few more inches - but after you figure that out, it can be set up anywhere.

The first night you love it for the new experience.... the 2nd or 3rd night you start to envy your tent friends. Don't give up though... My tent busted so I had to commit to this for a few more outtings, and now Its all I use. Take the time and adjust the tension for your comfort level. Practice getting in and out incase you need to use the facilitrees in the middle of the night you want to be able to get right back in.  Climbing into it while also trying to get into a sleeping bag seems impossible but it is easily mastered after a few attempts.The only criticism I have is that the doublenest hammock is very uncomfortable and awkward with 2 people. I would not recommend it. With one point of support at each end of this thing you will obviously gravitate towards the center and will be all up in eachothers business. Even alone you end up making a lot of adjustments in the middle of the night to stay comfortable, but in a double you wake your partner up every time you move.

      Khaki/BlackPackage Type: Standard Packaging",5,"Crawling into this hammock immediately releases 10% of stress from your body.  Napping in it is a surefire way to remove the remaining 90%.Setup is a snap and the integrated carry case in the form of the pocket is handy.I am 6 feet 2 inches tall and 275lbs.  The DoubleNest holds me just fine so if you're also a big ham fatty like me then you're covered.  The DoubleNest also has enough material to wrap around you completely.  I use this as a handy way to keep bugs off of me while I nap in the woods.You can attach the hammock to trees, poles, etc. with rope or the ENO straps.  I bought the Atlas straps and just solved the problem effortlessly.  Yeah, they're heavier than rope but whatever... they're cheap.  The Atlas straps also fit inside the DoubleNest carry pouch if you cram them in properly.  The whole thing winds up being about the size of a grapefruit.  It doesn't hurt very much when this ball of hammock hits you after someone throws it.A few potential flaws:1. You will have to discuss this product with everyone that sees it:  ""Who makes that?!  How much was it?! Where do I get one?!""  Honestly... it's like these people haven't heard of the Internet.2. The fabric is very thin which is good for weight but it also brings a surprise.  The fabric is so thin and the circulation so good around your behammocked supine body that you will lose heat quickly.  That's great for the summer but bad for cooler weather including summer nights at higher elevations.  You can try to squish a sleeping pad in there with your sleeping bag but it's finicky.  What will probably happen is that the sleeping pad winds up on top of you mysteriously in the night and your butt is freezing.  If you intend to overnight in a hammock then ENO makes a different product which might work better for you called the Reactor but it's not available in as many groovy colors.3. If you're like me then you'll take it everywhere because you think ""Yeah!  Relaxin' time!"" but then you'll get out to the beach like a moron and realize that there's nothing to attach it to.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE3JSD6Y5ZQHRNC7V3OIOFBVHJPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AE3JSD6Y5ZQHRNC7V3OIOFBVHJPQ"

      Khaki/MaroonPackage Type: Standard Packaging",5,"Just bought this a couple of weeks ago as my annual addition to our camping gear. We enjoyed our hammock SO much! At various times it was a ""hang out"" for 3 teenage girls, a snuggly place for momma and her 6 yo snuggly boy, R&R for various mommas, and even a little shut-eye time for the 13 yo boy! Definitely strong and sturdy! Very impressed!Bonus~ it is super portable (Due to the small size) , and extremely easy to use with the ENO Slap Straps Pro Hammock straps that I also purchased through Amazon. We were able to set up quick at a park that was a detour on our way home~ hubby got to hang out with the boys by the bay while the girls hit the sidewalk sales~ win/win! :)Planning to keep the hammock and the straps in the car (In their convenient bags) so that we can ""nest"" whenever/wherever the mood strikes us!",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHET7BN5I67P3CDM76OQYFURVSAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHET7BN5I67P3CDM76OQYFURVSAQ"

If you use this in conjunction with the Atlas hanging system by ENO, you will literally have the most versatile and convenient hammock setup available. The hammock has a carabiner on each end that attaches to the straps (sold seperately) for an easy setup every time, and when you're done hanging, the hammock rolls up into the bag that's actually sewn into the hammock itself. It doesn't get much quicker/easier than that. I also highly recommend the Atlas straps over the SlapStraps as they won't wear out over time and they give you way more hanging options. 2 thumbs up",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF3OOIOIZNMSFA33R4KVHAMB52ZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AF3OOIOIZNMSFA33R4KVHAMB52ZA"

I hang it up in my back yard and the kids fight over the chance to climb in and rock a while, or I can fall asleep peacefully if they don't notice me. Some day I would like to take it camping when I accompany my son's Boy Scout troop, as many hammock owners do. Regardless, hanging in this hammock makes me very happy.The hammock requires some kind of suspension lines. I initially bought a set of Slap Strap Pros, but they stretch a lot so I am replacing them with ENO's Atlas Straps.Note that I ordered this hammock in June of 2013, and it shipped with the older, solid metal carabiners that the manufacturer had already swapped out for lighter wire-gate carabiners. ENO sells replacement wire-gate 'biners on their web site, but says that these hammocks are essentially NOS and so they won't replace mine. :-( Not a huge deal, since I am not a gram-shaving backpacker, but I would have preferred not to have the sharp edges of the metal carabiners.

I have only had this hammock a few months so I can't talk to the longevity.  It is light, compact and everything is attached so there is nothing to lose.  My only complaint is that while the initial cost is not that expensive, there is a high cost for all other components.  Straps, bug net, rain cover, etc.  I have had to rig up my own setup for these just to save money. Overall I am please with my purchase and hope to use this for years to come.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGZ453IAWCQLLVW6PYO2LFENRWXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGZ453IAWCQLLVW6PYO2LFENRWXQ"

Was one of the bestnights sleep I have had on a recent canoe trip it puts no pressure on the body so none of the usualtossing and turning and was able to sleep almost flat due to the size and being able to lay at an angle.I am very seriously considering putting hooks up where I can sleep in this at home....haha. The only downfall Icould have with this tent is there is no way I could sleep 2 people in it unless you were very small people and didn'tcare to be on top of each other and swing and move from every moment they make.

One average persons weight should not make the material stretch out?) It was only in a two areas and I really loved reading in it everyday so I ignored it. UNTIL...After a few weeks, I noticed the red stripe around the edge had faded... ALOT!!!! so much it made it look like an old hammock.I called the manufacture (Eagles Nest) which told me that... Indeed they do fade if left out too long. (It was not stated in the advertisements that they should not be used daily?) I would not have bought such an expensive hammock... only to fade and show so much wear after a month!?Here's the CRAZY part.... Eagles Nest told me they could not help me directly since I bought it (here) through a distributor. Here's the worst part, the SELLER did not care to help me at all. When I contacted (MooseHead) they said ....""It was two days past their 30 return policy, SORRY!""I was so mad.... Unfortunately, I was new to AMAZON and did not realize that I could have filed a claim here with them.I decided to finally write this review months later when I came across that old worn out looking hammock in my storage shed.

I've carried my hammock through quite a bit even having it soaking wet and it still holds up like a champ. I even hang it under my bunk in my dorm room for a spot to chill. You don't know what you're missing until you get one.I'd recommend putting a layer of duct tape over the bag to protect it from the various thorns, briars, and limbs you encounter if you find yourself in the bush as often as I do.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEJTIGF3AVPKZOJLT3XRSQTJQNCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEJTIGF3AVPKZOJLT3XRSQTJQNCA"

      Navy/RoyalPackage Type: Standard Packaging",4,"I got this hammock to take to the second weekend of my Wood Badge training, and it was everything that I had hoped for.I did make some modifications to it. After reading the advice of the folks at Hammock Forums, I got rid of the heavy steel carabiners and the rope line that gathers the ends. I replaced them with some ""whoopie slings"" made out of amsteel, and got some tree straps made out of polypropylene rather than using ENO's Slap Straps which are made of nylon and have a reputation for stretching. The modifications were easy to make and with them the hammock is simplicity itself to setup and take down.So, why didn't this thing get 5 stars?  Because I felt the need to get rid of the stock suspension system and really heavy carabiner for something that is lighter weight and faster to use.  That modification did cost me about as much as the hammock did, but was well worth the money.I've now had this hammock for more than a year and a half. I've got no intention of tent camping again when I have the option of sleeping in this hammock. Since getting the hammock, I've stopped waking up with a sore neck and back and that alone makes this worth the money I've spent on it. My kids like it so much that my older son now has his own Eagles Nest Outfitters SingleNest Hammock and my younger two have homemade hammocks in colors that they picked themselves.Things to look for to get the best use from your hammock: trees that are 12 feet or so apart and trunks that have a diameter of at least 8 inches.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHBXGP57N7IGERLIZW7WYARWH2RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHBXGP57N7IGERLIZW7WYARWH2RA"

It is easy to setup and is way more comfortable than the ground or even an air bed that leaves you on the ground by morning anyways.

      Navy/RoyalPackage Type: Standard Packaging",5,"This hammock has revolutionized my backpacking experience.  Compared to a tent, its much lighter and way more comfortable.  I've only taken it on one trip so far so I can't comment on durability, but dirt and pine needles fell right off and I didn't experience any rips or tears after rolling around in it to test it out. If it does break down or wear out, I'll update this review.  I'm 6'2"" 180lbs and the length is just fine.  It's plenty wide enough for two people but I wouldn't want to share it with anyone who I have any personal boundaries with.  You will end up spooning or in continuous shoulder to toe contact.  I haven't tried the single nest but I'd recommend the double nest for one person because the extra space lets you sleep on your side and/or spread out.I strongly recommend the additional accessories, atlas straps, a bug net, and the rain tarp.  A giant swarm of blood sucking mosquitoes would have had their way with my body if it weren't for that bug net...Back to the hammock itself though, the color was true to the picture.  The nylon material felt sturdy and evenly distributed my weight.  The stuff sack is pro all the way around, small, self compressing, acts as a pocket when you have the hammock set up.  The attached carabiners worked just fine too.The setup does have an impact on its comfort, I found I liked it pulled lengthwise pretty tight so I could scoot myself up into a reading position, or droop to the middle a bit to sleep.

      Khaki/BlackPackage Type: Standard Packaging",5,"Let me say first that this has probably been one of the best purchases that I have made, ever. I like trying new things from time to time, so I decided I'd try sleeping on a hammock as a regular every night sleeper. It's comfy, you feel like you're floating in the air rather than being swallowed up by it. I set mine up in a bedroom along with this stand: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y0GH5S/ref=oh_details_o03_s01_i00I almost laughed when I got the package in the mail, because the box I got was almost the same size as a small flat rate box from the USPS. I guess I never realized just how small this thing was when completely crushed into it's attached compression bag. It's easy to wash, I just throw it in a cold wash along with my blanket and pillow and it comes out nicely. I'm not so sure that it would  take nicely to the dryer though, so I let it hang to air dry.Durability wise, it's good. It's just beginning to get a little frayed along the edges, but I have been using for three months straight now so I suppose that's to be expected. If you were using it for camping once in a while I'd expect it to have a very long life. Though for one person I would recommend this one: http://www.amazon.com/Eagles-Nest-Outfitters-SingleNest-Hammock/dp/B001DDPG9I/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1341634130&sr=1-1&keywords=Eagles+Nest+Outfitters There is a little bit too much extra nylon for one person when you have the double nest, but you never know when you might find a crazy hammock gal. ;)In short, it's pretty damn cool to sleep in a hammock every night. It's also loads cheaper to buy a new hammock and a stand rather than buy a used mattress and frame. You also might want to think about everything that happens on a bed before you buy used, which is one of the reasons I decided to get a hammock after sleeping on a futon for a months.

I wanted it primarily for camping purposes.  I've noticed that a lot of people use these rather than tents.  You can actually buy other devices similar to this that include a rain fly and enclose completely.  They are a bit pricey so I thought that I might grab one of these and experiment with it.  I bought a bug net from a surplus store and a camo tarp from Harbor Frieght for less than $20.  You'll need to get some hammock straps for this.  I tested it out on my back porch just using rope and that worked fine but you'll really need to get some straps for putting it between two trees.  There are a lot of options on Amazon so do a little research to find out what would work best for you.  This hammock folds nicely into a tight little bundle that will fit into the palm of your hand.  It was pretty easy to fold back up too.  If you want this for camping purpose (using this instead of a tent), then you are probably going to want to get a bug net and rain tarp.  The hammock does have a lot of extra fabric that can enclose you but does not have any velcro or snaps to keep it that way.  It falls in your face anyway so it probably isn't the best option.  This hammock is best for summer camping with a bug net.  It is pretty strong...but I have to admit that is was a little freaky getting into it the first time.

This is a very compact (about the size of a large grapefruit or perhaps a small cantaloupe) hammock that expands to seat up to 2 adults up to 400lbs total. The hammock is about 8-9 feet long fully extended and it's perfect for lounging just about anywhere. The hammock comes with two carabiners at the ends to attach to whatever fixed point you may have in place, but buyers should note that it does NOT come with any straps, so you'd be smart to buy some. Sadly this raises the total cost for most users to up around $80, and unfortunately it increases the bulk of the overall package when travelling. Particularly frustrating is the fact that the sack which this hammock folds up in to (which is integrated in to the hammock itself and doubles as a handy side pocket when in use) isn't big enough to hold both hammock and straps. That said, packing both hammocks and straps is still a pretty easy affair and the combination easily earns space in my backpack, kayak or suitcase when travelling on vacation.

      Navy/OlivePackage Type: Standard Packaging",5,"I've been backpacking the past 12 years with tents and various combinations of air mattresses, pads, mattresses + pads and have just never been able to get a good night's rest and would actually dread laying down at night.I'm a side sleeper and invariably would end up tossing and turning and wake up with my hips and shoulders hurting more the next morning than when I layed down.  At 50 something years old and having gotten my whole family involved with backpacking, I really needed an alternate solution as the mattress pads were getting larger/heavier and I didn't want to keep adding weight to my backpack.Then...... I discovered the hammock.  Oh..... what sweet relief this thing is.  I can lay almost flat in the hammock.  It rained for 12 hours the first trip out and I was able to lay/sleep in my hammock for those 12 hours and not wake up with those sore hips and shoulders.I am a converted tent camper and can't wait for my next trip now.Side note: The ENO Dry Fly worked ok during that 12 hour rain and did leak a little bit along the top seam.  I came home and sealed it with Seam Sealer, so can't comment on the Seam Sealer just yet.The ENO Pro Straps are conveninent to use, but since they are made of nylon, they stretch during the night and I found myself bumping the ground on the first night.  The second night, I just placed the straps higher up the tree to account for the stretch.  I have now replaced the ENO Pro Straps with polyester straps and a whoopie sling combination for less stretch and more precise ""dialing"" in of the hammock suspension system.  I will also be adding an adjustable ridge line to really ""lock"" the setup in place.  I am really looking forward to many more years of backpacking.  I cannot recommend the ENO Pro Straps for backpacking because of the stretch in the nylon.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZGLFHDYQECW5RN7P6GG5UEZQZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHZGLFHDYQECW5RN7P6GG5UEZQZA"

On any nice day you will see a growing number of students napping, studying, or literally 'hanging out' in ENOs. I've seen friends hang their hammocks between columns on porches, inside gazebos, and between trees camping in the mountains.The hammock itself is durable, comfortable, and very lightweight. It comes equipped with 2 carabiners, so if you have rope or SlapStraps you can hang it up as soon as you open it!

I've had my hammock for two weeks and it has already gotten a ton of usage.This thing is so darn (got to keep this PG) comfortable. You can lay in it, you can sit in it, and it is perfect either way.It feels incredibly sturdy. I was a little skeptical at first about how this relatively lightweight material could hold so much weight, but I don't doubt it anymore. While the material is lightweight, the packed up ball is rather heavy. This is understandable, but if you're hiking it is something to consider. The packaged ball doesn't take up too much space.If you are hiking and you wanted to bring this as opposed to a tent, I'm sure the bug netting, rainfly, possibly gear holder would make great accessories and make this a great option for sleeping. I know I wanted to sleep in it.Three suggestions:1) Buy the Pro Straps. They give you a lot of flexibility.2) When hanging your hammock, hang it as tight as it will go. Get in. It will have stretched out a bit. Get out. Hang it on tighter notches if you please. Repeat as necessary. This wasn't as necessary the more times I've used it.3) If you're hanging it on a skinny tree, you may want to wrap the straps around more than once. I looped it around and then through another one of the holes. Not sure if the manufacturer recommends this (so differ to them), but it worked fine for me.Overall, I highly suggest this product.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEPXVPD22JAWKEIGHQICI6OSPSDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEPXVPD22JAWKEIGHQICI6OSPSDQ"

This hammock is the one luxury item that I always take on my ultralight backpacking trips, but only after the proper modifications of course. First, I lost the big black buckle strap that is stitched onto the outside of the attached stuff sack. The strap barely worked if even, and removing it cut some weight. Second, I lost the biners which came with this thing. Those big, hulking, sharp, heavy, abominations were the source of ALOT of the overall weight of this product.... something to the score of over 5 oz. of weight. I always carry 2 VERY light weight climbing quality Blackdiamond Biners with me for various uses around camp, I simply use those when I want to hang my hammock.This hammock is easily modifiable to accomodate much more compact dedicated suspension methods to a high degree of success (think hennessy hammock). It is advisable that these mods may not hold up the weight of 2 people (a single athletic build person would be fine) But if you plan on lounging with your sweetheart after a long days hike, do yourself a favor and get the tree huggers... they add a tad more weight than I would care for but are a surefire way to avoid the dreaded busted coccyx.... (I learned this lesson the hard way)And to people who aren't interested in hiking, camping, backpacking, etc... but want a nice lightweight, colorful, travel hammock that you can EASILY set up almost anywhere that there are some trees, this is worth it.... especially if you get a deal like I got..

      Orange/GreyPackage Type: Standard Packaging",5,"What can you say? I love this hammock and the easy portability of it. I've now used it to sleep in while camping, in my local park back home, for quick naps on bike trails, on campus at college, and really your options are only limited by your imagination. The DoubleNest is a must because it gives you extra wiggle room. Two people is definitely a push, but not impossible (you're gonna be in the person's space, so make it a girl you like and you're set!). If you were wondering, practically EVERYONE has the Orange/Grey combo. Doesn't bother me, but I thought I should put it out there.When it comes to sleeping in it while camping, I only recommend warm weather use. I used it in February when we had a warmer weekend here at App State, but the temperature dropped down into the 20s, and we were down in Linville Gorge by the river (across from Devil's Hole). The wind was terrible and came through the thin polyester, especially on the bottom side. Even in my good sleeping bag, I kept waking up because I was so cold, and my toes became numb because I had slid to the bottom of the hammock and my feet were more exposed. The DoubleNest allowed me to wrap the sides around my body like a cocoon, and it definitely saved me from freezing in the wind. ALSO, keep in mind that the polyester WILL STRETCH. This means if you hang up closer to the ground, you will probably end up touching it.All these things to consider just come with the territory, and should be nothing that prevents you from buying one. I know ENO offers a thermal quilt system for like $180 that goes around your hammock, but I'd say just stick to a tent if it's gonna be cold weather. Otherwise, relax and go hammock away. It's by far one of the best purchases I have ever made.

      Orange/GreyPackage Type: Standard Packaging",4,"I've really been enjoying my ENO Double Nest Hammock.  While still extremely light and packs into a very small space, it is stronger and heavier than most others available.  The small additional weight comes from the use of superior components, such as the parachute nylon material, the use of carabiners, and the marine-grade cord that binds the end, but it also gives you more:  More weight capacity, so you can hammock with a friend if you like; More durability that comes from materials that should stand up to longer use; More value that comes from a longer-lasting product that has greater flexibility. (can carry two of you rather than one)  I get more confidence from this hammock, too, as it just doesn't seem as stressed when I get in it as some others that come to mind.  The size is generous, going along with the capacity to hold two people, and there is enough fabric to wrap over one person completely if they are in there solo.  A stuff sack with compression strap comes with the hammock and remains attached to one side - a nice feature.However, it also comes with a higher price tag, and that's something to think about when considering whether the additional capacity and potential durability make it worth it to you.  Is it worth it?  Consider that this one comes with carabiners for attachment:  Do you already have some of these that you can use?  Do you really need them?  (Personally, while I like that it has them, I don't think they are necessary.  S hooks are cheaper but are also perfectly adequate for keeping you and your hammock aloft.  In other words, carabiners are nice, but you are paying for them, too...)  Also, this hammock does not come with attachment ropes.  You can get ENO Slap Straps eno SlapStrap Hammock Suspension Systems - Pro and Regular(which I have used and have also been happy with) but you pay extra for those, too.  Using your own rope or webbing, which both have many more uses than for dedicated hammock duty AND come with mammoth weight ratings, can be a less expensive proposition.  (Rigging your own attachment may confer upon you significant street cred with the survivalist crowd; urban posers like me, however, get the slap straps first and then learn to make my own rope attachments later...)Having said all that, this is a top-quality hammock, with superior components and high quality construction.  What I compare this to most often is the Grand Trunk Ultralight Hammock: Grand Trunk Ultralight Hammock Granted, it's not an apples to apples comparison here, as the Grand Trunk unit is significantly lighter and has a lower weight capacity.  But, I appreciate the huge value that the Grand Trunk hammock represents, as it is a fraction of the cost of the Double Nest AND comes with high-quality and strong (if relatively thin) attachment ropes included.  I've got both and I use both regularly, but in different circumstances.  I love them both, too, so I really couldn't say to choose one over the other - it really depends on your use patterns, frequency of use, and financial wherewithal.So, I can definitely recommend this hammock.  So why only four stars?  Because, well, at this price I think they really could have thrown in a set of ropes rather than selling them to you separately.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHN22PZT5J4PWUTUG7K32KIROH6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHN22PZT5J4PWUTUG7K32KIROH6Q"

      Khaki/BlackPackage Type: Standard Packaging",5,"I've loved hammocks since I had my first $9 nylon mesh net model at Scout camp more than 20 years ago.  I didn't like getting my fingers (or things attached to my belt) stuck in the little holes, however.  Fast forward to the present day, and I'm a much bigger fellow.  I wanted to find a hammock that could handle a big man, and yet still be light enough to pack in on wilderness adventures, like trips to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCA).That's when I found the Eagles Nest Outfitters (ENO) DoubleNest Hammock.  The DoubleNest may be intended for two with its 400-lb weight rating, but I found it ideal for this big guy--plenty of room and no worries about reaching that weight limit.It packs down quite small, and is very reasonable at less than 1.5 lbs.  Sleeping in it was like heaven!  There was enough material on the sides that I could pull it up around me if the breeze was a bit cool, and I loved how the integrated stuff sack served as a gear pocket so I could store items while at rest.The cordage on the hammock has proven to be resilient, and the carabiner clips on the ends are wonderfully sturdy.  I had no concerns about them breaking.ENO offers a lot of accessories that are compatible with this hammock, including bug netting and a rain tarp, but I've simply been enjoying it as an extra luxury in camp.  I have seen, however, many people in the BWCA set up with just their ENO hammocks as their camping rigs--talk about packing light!TIP---You'll still need straps or rope to attach the hammock lines to the tree trunks.  I took two eight-foot sections of poly cord (with the appropriate weight rating), and knotted the loose ends on each (effectively making two closed loops).  To attach the lines around the tree, I'd just reach a knotted loop around behind the trunk and then fed the looped end through the knotted end (basically, making a larks head know).  I then clipped the hammock's clip to the loop and repeated the steps on the other tree trunk.  If I needed the loop lines shorter, I could just add a knot before the loop.  If I needed more line, I could unknot the loop and just tie it alone.Those loops, however, made setup and takedown very quick, and were far less expensive than buying official hammock straps.OVERALL-------The ENO DoubleNest Hammock is absolutely wonderful.  I strongly recommend one for any of you larger campers, or for campers who are (or, like me, soon will be) light enough to share the DoubleNest with someone they love.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH6UXFQKSOZGQFQ3ULKEGW4L5BRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AH6UXFQKSOZGQFQ3ULKEGW4L5BRA"

      Powder/RoyalPackage Type: Standard Packaging",5,"This was THE best nights sleep I've ever had camping! When I went, it was quite cold so I needed my sleeping pad (and let me tell you... learning to sleep in a hammock with a pad and bag can be quite the challenge) to keep my back from freezing. While sleeping in a hammock is a bit more chilly than in a tent, you can easily shift weight and move around unlike in a tent where you move from one side to the other and your hips (or at least mine!) end up seriously painful when morning comes.The set up is super easy - get the slap straps as they are a breeze to use! - and went quite fast. Just make sure you hang it high enough that over the course of the night, your eno doesn't end up on the ground.I've never had any other camping hammock, but I have slept the night in a regular 1 person before and I find that for someone like me who likes to change positions, the 2 person is perfect.

I am almost 30 years old and have never been camping in my adult life because of the awkward sleeping positions I have to use to get some shut-eye.Though these hammocks are exceptionally cold in the cooler climates, they are a relief in the humid West Virginia summers.  In cooler temperatures, it is possible to drape one of the space blankets on the underside of the hammock.  The space blanked reflects about 80% of the body temperature back to you so that 20 degree sleeping is actually effective.  By the way, while using this hammock on a 40 degree night in conjunction with a 20 degree bag, I nearly froze to death.I love this hammock!

      Navy/RoyalPackage Type: Standard Packaging",5,"I got to try out my friend's ENO singlenest hammock before actually investing in my own.  And I say investment because these hammocks are not cheap.  If you are an amateur and infrequent hammock user there's no need to buy an ENO.  There are other brands that are just as comparable but for 1/3 the price.  However, this hammock is top of the line.  It packs down small, is very lightweight, easy to setup, and is very comfortable for two people.  My husband and I are not large people by any means (I'm 5'4 and he's 5'8"") so we fit perfectly without actually smothering eachother.  If you are a single user you may feel swallowed up but the extra fabric is lightweight so I didn't have a major problem with it.  Because these hammocks do not come with straps you must purchase them separately.  I recommend the slap straps pro because of the length versatility.  My friend had the regular straps (which are also very easy to use) but for maximum compatibility with whatever the setup situation may be, I would get the slap straps pro.  There's nothing more frustrating than getting your hammock and not being able to set it up because the trees available are just not quite close enough.  So spend the extra $5-$10 and get pro straps.
