<h2>First Look at Lucid</h2>
<div id="objective" class="section level4">
<h4>Objective:</h4>
<p>I have been tasked with helping document processes for our company as we are begining the process of overhauling our systems/processes and incorporating an ERP system.</p>
<p>One of the tools I was introducted to for this project was Lucid <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com" class="uri">https://www.lucidchart.com</a>. I thought I would give my initial thoughts on the software thus far.</p>
</div>
<div id="so-what-is-it" class="section level4">
<h4>So what is it?</h4>
<p>Lucid is a web process mapping software. You sign up, pay a subscription fee and you can use and publish as you see fit. There is also a Team Subscription that allows you and your group to collaborate. This would be great for undocumented procedures.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of flow charts, mind maps, etc. There are a ton of individual Shapes, fonts and my favorite (which has been a serious pain in every other mapping software I’ve used) the automatic fit of arrows. They just flow.</p>

<div id="what-does-it-do" class="section level4">
<h4>What does it do?</h4>
<p>It helps with Process Mapping. It’s like Vizio but so much simpler to use (sorry Vizio). Within the first 30 minutes working with it I created a workflow for one of the processes I take part in every day. Moreover I was able to publish it to R Markdown (this blog was created in R Markdown) with the push of a button. See Below:</p>

<div id="overall-impressions" class="section level4">
<h4>Overall Impressions:</h4>
<p>I would like to learn more about how to create Process maps. It appears that there is a section on the website that helps with that so that’s cool. I learned a few tricks like copy and pasting blocks and dragging arrows (as opposed to creating new ones and getting the right size, etc) but I would like to learn more. I assume with a few flow charts I’ll have it down.</p>
<p>Regarding ease of use. Couldn’t be easier. It’s great. They offer a 7 day free trial so give it a whirl. Even cleaning my house might get its own flow chart? It’s that easy and quick to create.</p>
<p>I will follow up in 30 days to see where I’m at. But my first hour long exposure has been extremely positive.</p>
