<div id="seattle-sunny-day-streaks" class="section level1">
<h1>Seattle Sunny Day Streaks</h1>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> If you’re like me when the sun comes out after a couple cloudy days my mood lifts quite a bit - even more so than when it’s been sunny for a couple days. Perhaps its the contrast between the two? Nevertheless I was curious how many shifts on average we will have from cloudy days to sunny days, in other words how many mood lifts can we estimate to have in a year living in Seattle.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> I found the average days of sun for Seattle over many years in ratio form. I then did a simulation using that ratio to calculate the average sunny day streaks. I then compiled that data. I then wanted to count only the shifts. Those days where it was cloudy and then turned to sun. Below you will find my results.</p>
<p>This method also could be used for baseball hits, wins and losses, and anything with a binary ratio.</p>

<div id="build-out-the-function" class="section level2">
<h2>Build out the Function</h2>
<p>This is a function I found in the statsr package (I tweeked it a bit for my purpose). It works well for this project.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#function
calc_streak = function(x){
  if (!is.atomic(x))
    x = x[,1]
  if (any(!x %in% c(&quot;S&quot;,&quot;C&quot;)))
    stop(&#39;Input should only contain hits (&quot;S&quot;) and misses (&quot;C&quot;)&#39;)
  y = rep(0,length(x))
  y[x == &quot;S&quot;] = 1
  y = c(0, y, 0)
  wz = which(y == 0)
  streak = diff(wz) - 1
  return(data.frame(length = streak))
}</code></pre>

<h2>Gather the Ratio Data</h2>
<p>I was able to gather the sunny day data at <a href="https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Washington/annual-days-of-sunshine.php" class="uri">https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Washington/annual-days-of-sunshine.php</a>.</p>
Here is the data:<br />

</center>
<center>
<img src="/images/ratio.jpg" />
</center>
<p>So the ratio is about 43%. Which really is a stretch because he is defining Partly Sunny days as days when sun reaches the ground. A better ratio and perhaps one I’ll use below would be Sunny Days (All Sun). That ratio would be 19% vs the 43%. I’ll start there.</p>

<div id="start-building-out-the-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Start Building out the Model</h2>
<p>Since this is a binary variable I’ll create the outcomes as <em>S</em> for Sunny and <em>C</em> for Cloudy.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>outcomes &lt;- data.frame(c(&quot;S&quot;, &quot;C&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><br>,</p>
<p>Now I will create a random sample of 365 days with the probailities of a Sunny day equal to 43% and Cloudy Day of 57%.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1234)
Seattle_Weather &lt;- sample_n(outcomes, 365, replace = T, weight = c(.43, .57))</code></pre>
<p><br>,</p>
<p>We can see from the sample that there were 144 Sunny Days and 221 Cloudy Days. That’s close to our initial probalities.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table(Seattle_Weather)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Seattle_Weather
##   C   S 
## 221 144</code></pre>
<p><br>,</p>
<p>Ok now I’m going to pass the Seattle Weather Data into the Function, which will show what the Sunny Streaks are.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sunny_streak &lt;- calc_streak(Seattle_Weather)

table(sunny_streak$length)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##   0   1   2   3   4   5   8 
## 134  62  11   8   2   4   1</code></pre>
<p><br>,</p>
<p>It appears the probability of having 5 or more consecutive Sunny Days is pretty rare. Chances of having a sunny two consecutive sunny days is more likely, etc.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(sunny_streak, aes(length)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = &quot;skyblue&quot;) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,15,1)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title = &quot;Number of Consecutive Sunny Days from 365 Day Sample&quot;, x = &quot;Consecutive Days of Sun&quot;, y = &quot;Number of Days&quot;)</code></pre>

<div id="but-how-many-days-does-the-weather-change-from-cloudy-to-sunny-thats-what-really-what-im-after-here." class="section level2">
<h2>But how many days does the weather change from Cloudy to Sunny? That’s what really what I’m after here.</h2>
<p>Turns out in this sample Data Set there were 88 changes where it was cloudy one day and sunny the next. In other words, we will have that nice positive <em>after the clouds</em> mood boost 88 times in a year on average. Not bad.</p>
<p>It could be worst… We could live in Arizona where it’s sunny most of the time, so much so that we don’t appreciate it as much. There is an upside I suppose to being in the overcast area of the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<div id="future-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Future Analysis</h2>
<p>I could bootstrap 100’s of years together to get an average and look to see what the variance is. I would guess, that it would be relatively close to the 80 mark and I’m fine with that. I have better things to do. I thought this would be fun and interesting, however. I hope you enjoyed. And happy moods!</p>
