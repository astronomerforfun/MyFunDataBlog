#Seattle Sunny Day Streaks

**Objective:**  If you're like me when the sun comes out after a couple cloudy days my mood lifts quite a bit - even more so than when it's been sunny for a couple days.  Perhaps its the contrast between the two?  Nevertheless I was curious how many shifts on average we will have from cloudy days to sunny days, in other words how many mood lifts can we estimate to have in a year living in Seattle.  

**Method:**  I found the average days of sun for Seattle over many years in ratio form.  I then did a simulation using that ratio to calculate the average sunny day streaks.  I then compiled that data.  I then wanted to count only the shifts.  Those days where it was cloudy and then turned to sun.  Below you will find my results.

This method also could be used for baseball hits, wins and losses, and anything with a binary ratio.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2) #Graphing package
library(dplyr) #Data Manipulation
library(DT) #Data tables
```

## Build out the Function

This is a function I found in the statsr package (I tweeked it a bit for my purpose).  It works well for this project.

```{r}
#function
calc_streak = function(x){
  if (!is.atomic(x))
    x = x[,1]
  if (any(!x %in% c("S","C")))
    stop('Input should only contain hits ("S") and misses ("C")')
  y = rep(0,length(x))
  y[x == "S"] = 1
  y = c(0, y, 0)
  wz = which(y == 0)
  streak = diff(wz) - 1
  return(data.frame(length = streak))
}
```


## Gather the Ratio Data

I was able to gather the sunny day data at https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Washington/annual-days-of-sunshine.php.  

Here is the data:  
<center>
![](/images/sunny_days.jpg)
</center>
<center>
![](/images/ratio.jpg)
</center>
So the ratio is about 43%.  Which really is a stretch because he is defining Partly Sunny days as days when sun reaches the ground.  A better ratio and perhaps one I'll use below would be Sunny Days (All Sun).  That ratio would be 19% vs the 43%.  I'll start there.

## Start Building out the Model

Since this is a binary variable I'll create the outcomes as *S* for Sunny and *C* for Cloudy.
```{r}
outcomes <- data.frame(c("S", "C"))
```
br(),

Now I will create a random sample of 365 days with the probailities of a Sunny day equal to 43% and Cloudy Day of 57%.  
```{r}
set.seed(1234)
Seattle_Weather <- sample_n(outcomes, 365, replace = T, weight = c(.43, .57))

```
br(),


We can see from the sample that there were 144 Sunny Days and 221 Cloudy Days. That's close to our initial probalities.

```{r}

table(Seattle_Weather)
```
br(),

Ok now I'm going to pass the Seattle Weather Data into the Function, which will show what the Sunny Streaks are.


```{r}
sunny_streak <- calc_streak(Seattle_Weather)

table(sunny_streak$length)
```
br()

It appears the probability of having 5 or more consecutive Sunny Days is pretty rare.  Chances of having a sunny two consecutive sunny days is more likely, etc.

```{r}
ggplot(sunny_streak, aes(length)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,15,1)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title = "Number of Consecutive Sunny Days from 365 Day Sample", x = "Consecutive Days of Sun", y = "Number of Days")
```
br(),


## But how many days does the weather change from Cloudy to Sunny?  That's what really what I'm after here.

Turns out in this sample Data Set there were 88 changes where it was cloudy one day and sunny the next.  In other words, we will have that nice positive *after the clouds* mood boost 88 times in a year on average.  Not bad.  

It could be worst...  We could live in Arizona where it's sunny most of the time, so much so that we don't appreciate it as much.  There is an upside I suppose to being in the overcast area of the Pacific Northwest. 

## Future Analysis

I could bootstrap 100's of years together to get an average and look to see what the variance is.  I would guess, that it would be relatively close to the 80 mark and I'm fine with that.  I have better things to do.  I thought this would be fun and interesting, however.  I hope you enjoyed.  And happy moods!  

```{r}

colnames(Seattle_Weather) <- "Weather"
for(i in 1:nrow(Seattle_Weather)){
 if(Seattle_Weather$Weather[i] == "C" & Seattle_Weather$Weather[i + 1] == "S"){
   Seattle_Weather$Change[i] <- 1
 } else {
   Seattle_Weather$Change[i] <- 0
 }
}
sum(Seattle_Weather$Change)




```
