## Image Classification

Objective:  I wanted to see if I could build a Neural Network that could identify a Plane vs a Car.  To do so I downloaded 12 pictures, 6 of which were airplanes and 6 that were cars.  I then created the Network using Google Tensorflow and Keras Package to train the model.  I then tested the model on two pictures.  The results are below:

Methodology:

1) Download Pictures using ReadImages
2) Normalize Pictures since they are different sizes
3) Reshape Pictures for Model using array_reshape from Keras Package
4) Create Training Set and Training Labels/Create Test Set and Labels
5) Build Neural Network
6) Run the Model
7) Test model on never before seen pictures.

#### Download Packages

EBImage is a package that reads in the JPEG's and converts them to numeric values based on the image size.

```{r}
library(EBImage)
library(keras)
```
<br>

#### Put Pictrues into a Vector

I labeled the pictures with a p for airplane and c for car.  

```{r}
pics <- c("p1.JPEG", "p2.JPEG","p3.JPEG", "p4.JPEG", "p5.JPEG", "p6.JPEG","c1.JPEG", "c2.JPEG", "c3.JPEG", "c4.JPEG", "c5.JPEG", "c6.JPEG")

```


<br>

#### Read in the Pictures

ReadImage is the function within the EBimage package that is needed to do this project.  I have not found a comparison package.

```{r}
mypic <- list()

for(i in 1:12){
  mypic[[i]] <- readImage(pics[i])
}
```

<br>

#### Look at Image

The images are now converted to numerical data, which I can use to build the Network.

```{r}
print(mypic[[6]])
```
<br>

```{r}
display(mypic[[6]])
```

#### Normalizing

Since the pictures are different sizes I will need to normalize them.  I can do this using the resize function with a for loop.  The result is 12 pictures that are 28 by 28 pixels.

```{r}
for(i in 1:12){
  mypic[[i]] <- resize(mypic[[i]], 28,28)
}
```
<br>

#### Reshaping the Data

I then reshape the data using array_reshape from the Keras Package. What this does is creates a matrix with each vector containing 28 by 28 by 3 or 2,352 rows.  This will help us run the data through the model.
```{r}
for(i in 1:12){
  mypic[[i]] <- array_reshape(mypic[[i]], c(28,28,3))
}
str(mypic)
```
<br>

#### Rbind the data

We now have 10 rows with 2,352 columns.


```{r}
trainx <- NULL
for(i in 1:5){ #first 5 planes 6th one for testing
  trainx<- rbind(trainx, mypic[[i]])
}
for(i in 7:11){ #12 used for testing
  trainx <- rbind(trainx, mypic[[i]])
}
str(trainx)
```
<br>

#### Testing Images

I am going to use picture 6 and picture 12 for testing.  One is a plane the other is a car.

```{r}
testx <- rbind(mypic[[6]], mypic[[12]])
```
<br>

#### Dependent Variable

0 is a plane and 1 is a car.  If you remember the first 6 pictures were planes and the last 6 were cars.  But we used one of each for testing.  So the first 5 are planes or "0" and the last 5 are cars or "1".
The test was a plane first and a car second.

```{r}
trainy <- c(0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1)
testy <- c(0,1)
```
<br>

#### One Hot Encoding


```{r}
trainLabels <- to_categorical(trainy)
testlabels <- to_categorical(testy)
```
<br>

#### Building Neural Network

```{r}
model <- keras_model_sequential()
model %>%
  layer_dense(units = 256, activation = "relu", input_shape = c(2352))%>%
  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = "relu")%>%
  layer_dense(units = 2, activation = "softmax")
summary(model)

model%>%
  compile(loss = "binary_crossentropy",
          optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(),
          metrics= c("accuracy"))

history <- model%>%
  fit(trainx,
      trainLabels,
      epochs = 30,
      batch_size = 32,
      validation_split = 0.2)
plot(history)
```
<br>

#### Running Model

Accuracy was 100%.

```{r}
model %>% evaluate(trainx, trainLabels)
```
<br>

#### Confusion Matrix

We accurately classified all the planes and all the cars.

```{r}
pred <- model %>%
  predict_classes(trainx)

table(Predicted = pred, Actual = trainy)
```
<br>

```{r}
prob <- model %>%
  predict_proba(trainx)
options(scipen = 99999)
cbind(prob, Predicted = pred, Actual = trainy)
```
<br>

#### How does it do on images it hasn't seen?

It also accuratly identifies the images.  

```{r}
model %>%
  evaluate(testx, testlabels)

pred <- model%>% predict_classes(testx)

table(Predicted = pred, Actual = testy)
```
